beneath the roots of the world lies Damnation—not merely a place, but a divine mechanism, a realm of consequence, reflection, and immutable law. It is the Spiral of Sin, where souls descend not because they are cast down, but because they choose to fall. It is often called Hell, but not in anger or hatred—it is called that in truth.Unlike the heavens, which are homes to gods and stars, Damnation is without gods. No divine power can endure its terms. Its law is older than morality. No war is fought here. The Spiral does not require defense. Every soul in Damnation faces its own reflection, and that is enough.Each Circle is formed from a single Sin—not as punishment, but as mirror. The deeper one descends, the more refined, internal, and painful the sin becomes. At the Spiral’s center lies Despair—not the worst sin, but the final one, where the soul ceases to try.\nPride – The refusal to kneel; the lie that one is already perfect.\nEnvy – Coveting without understanding; the hunger for someone else's truth.\nWrath – Fire that believes itself justice.\nLust – The consumption of others to feed a hollow self.\nGreed – The endless gathering of what can never satisfy.\nGluttony – Want turned into worship.\nSloth – The denial of potential through stillness.\nDeceit – The soul sculpted from lies, forgotten even by its maker.\nDespair – The belief that nothing can change, and that hope is a lie.\nAt the highest Circle, where the Spiral begins, stands Lucina, the Angel of Damnation. She is the crown of judgment, the voice of the Spiral, and the incarnation of Pride. Not fallen, not cursed—she was made for this, by the god Trill, master of life, death, and dragons.Lucina is flawless in form, and utterly calm in presence. She does not rage, she does not punish. She reveals. When she speaks, illusions fall away. She sees souls as they are—and does not blink.\nTitles: The Crown of Judgment, Flame That Does Not Bow Domain: Pride, Damnation, Condemnation Symbol: A silver flame coiled around a broken crown Known For: Perfect memory; she forgets nothing and forgives only what transforms. Though forged in justice, Lucina is not cold. She adores one above all—her brother in spirit:Silent, gentle, and unknowable, the Angel of Fate walks every Circle unseen. He is not a ruler, but a witness. He watches the turning of choices, and speaks only when the weight of destiny demands it.Created by Fionil, the goddess of time, space, and mind, the Angel of Fate is the executor of her dreams. Where she shapes eternity, he threads the present into it.To Lucina, he is a little brother. She loves him without pride—perhaps the only love in her heart untouched by sin. His presence softens her, though she would never admit it.\nTitles: The Threadkeeper, He Who Walks Before Domain: Fate, Destiny, Pattern Symbol: A golden thread wrapped around an hourglass Known For: Speaking only when no one else dares. Where the Spiral ends—in the Ninth Circle, Despair—there walks Cupin, the Angel of Sin, servant of Onigod, goddess of arcane trickery and joyful cruelty. Cupin is paradox made flesh: an angel who tempts rather than saves, who mocks the damned not to torture—but to wake them.She moves between the Circles with laughter on her lips and mercy hidden in her riddles. She offers no escape, only understanding—the cruelest and kindest gift of all.\nTitles: The Smiling Chain, Laugher in the Dark Domain: Sin, Temptation, Reflection Symbol: A black glass mask, cracked at the mouth Known For: Making souls laugh at their own damnation. Cupin does not belong to Damnation, yet she belongs there perfectly. Her laughter is what remains when all hope is gone. In that laughter, sometimes, is the first flicker of change.No gods dwell in Damnation. Not even the highest, not even the cruelest. The Spiral rejects divine force. Its laws are self-contained, born of choice and consequence.But angels remain—Lucina, the Judge; Fate, the Witness; Cupin, the Mirror. They are not enemies of the gods—they are their instruments. Lucina serves Trill, god of life, death, and dragons. The Angel of Fate serves Fionil, goddess of time, space, and mind.

Few pass through. Fewer still return with mind and memory intact. I am one of those fools blessed—or cursed—by the Laughing Veil to walk beyond.The Feywild, or as the Old Tongue names it, Tír na Lán Draíochta, is a realm woven from raw emotion, memory, and dream. It does not follow our seasons nor our logic. Maps are lies, time is a song, and every shadow watches.Herein I present my field notes—a humble attempt to chronicle the beings, customs, and perils of that place. Heed these words not as law, but as lantern light in a place where the stars have minds of their own.Chapter One: The Nature of Faerie\nTime and Memory\nA minute in the Feywild may be a week in our realm—or a century.The fey remember stories more than facts. Tell a lie cleverly enough and it may become truth.\nGeography of Emotion\nLandscapes shift with the emotional tone of their rulers.Sadness may summon endless rain; joy may turn forests into crystal.Major locations include:Tellu-Mountain: The divine seat of the gods Tellemori and Onigod.The Mirrorhall: A palace of reflection, ruled by the Lady of Fey.The Spiral Maze: Temple of Onigod; an ever-changing trial of wit and will.\nRules of the Realm\nNever give your full name.Gifts given must be repaid. Even compliments.Iron wounds but also enrages; use it only if you seek exile or war.Keep no food unless gifted—it will rot, grow teeth, or speak in riddles.Chapter Two: The Courts of FaerieSeelie CourtAlso known as the Summer Court.Ruled by joy, passion, light, and mischief.Led by a radiant Queen whose name changes with the sun.Favors beauty, cleverness, and hospitality.Unseelie CourtThe Court of Winter, Night, and Secret Decay.Led by a silent King clad in frost and silver.Honesty and etiquette are prized—but missteps are fatal.Liminal FeyNot of either court. Includes dreamwalkers, rootspirits, and fire-moths.Often live in places of transition—crossroads, ruins, or forgotten wells.Chapter Three: The Ninefold TricksterOne of the great Archfey, and the most beguiling spirit I encountered, is the Ninefold Trickster—a radiant fox spirit with nine searing tails.Titles: The Gilded Flame, She of Burning Riddles, Mistress of MasksAppearance:Often appears as a breathtaking woman with fox features—nine tails, flickering eyes, robes of firelight.Her domain is the Crimson Grove, where foxfire burns forever and secrets bloom like flowers.Domain:Illusion, Fire, Domination, and StoriesMortals who make pacts with her often trade secrets, names, or future memories in exchange for power.Customs:She adores cleverness, theatricality, and poetic irony.Never answer her directly. Dance around truths and she'll favor you.Chapter Four: Fey Conduct and MannersGreetingsA bow is safer than a handshake.Always compliment their appearance—but subtly, or you may owe them a poem.DangersNever accept a second gift.Do not eat or drink unless it has your name whispered into it.Music is sacred; bad songs are punishable offenses.GamesRiddles are duels.Dance contests may determine fate.Bargains are law. Even lost bets carry magical consequence.Chapter Five: Onigod and TellemoriAt the heart of the Feywild’s paradox lie its two divine creators:Tellemori – the Dreaming DepthGod of earth, water, and patience.Appears in groves as stone-eyed watchers or flowing springs.His silence is worth more than words.Onigod – the Laughing VeilGoddess of illusion, mischief, and arcana.Her laughter is literally woven into the magic of the Feywild.She is not cruel—merely far too clever.They do not war, but create in tandem. Their angels walk the realm:The Lady of Fey: A sovereign of emotion and etiquette.Plantios: Angel of growth, time, and decay.Ioki: Trickster-child of Onigod, both prankster and prophet.Chapter Six: Survival and EscapeIf you find yourself in the Feywild:Do not panic. It smells fear like perfume.Offer stories and songs for safe passage.Carry a charm of silver, not iron.Always leave a gift before you leave—flowers, tears, or a truth never told.Escape is not always about finding the path out. Sometimes it is about being allowed to leave.Many who remain become fey themselves. Some don’t notice until they no longer cast shadows.Final NoteI have left much unwritten. This is not cowardice, but mercy. For if I taught you all I know, you would be cursed with knowledge the Fey themselves would envy.May your feet walk lightly and your words fall like honey.— Alwin Maerlin","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"realms/feywild/the-faerie-compendium/the-faerie-compendium-1.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057707142,"modifiedTime":1748385324954,"sourceSize":4922,"sourcePath":"Realms/Feywild/The Faerie Compendium/The Faerie Compendium 1.md","exportPath":"realms/feywild/the-faerie-compendium/the-faerie-compendium-1.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":31,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"realms/feywild/the-faerie-compendium/the-faerie-compendium-2.html":{"title":"The Faerie Compendium 2","icon":"","description":"The Faerie Codex, Vol. II: Of Courts, Pacts, and Power\nCompiled by Corbin Thorne, Professor Emeritus of Invisible Histories, Fiondellian Academy of Esoteric StudiesOn the Courts That Shape the SeasonsThough most folk imagine Faeries as singular creatures of whimsy, they belong to Courts—ancient and powerful allegiances that reflect not politics, but temperament, tide, and transformation.The Seelie Court – Brightlords and GleamkinTo the untrained eye, the Seelie Court seems a place of light and laughter. Golden meadows, eternal twilight, festivals spun from dreamstuff. But beneath the joy is a chilling precision.The Seelie believe in hospitality, etiquette, and beautiful deceit. They may bless your child with song—or bind your bloodline to a riddle never to be solved. To offend a Seelie noble is to offend a story itself.Their Monarch: Queen Dandelaithe, the Ever-Golden, a being of blinding presence and subtle cruelty. Her laughter blooms roses; her wrath, thornstorms.The Unseelie Court – Thornbound and HollowedThey are not evil. Repeat this, lest you insult them. The Unseelie walk the darker currents of nature—withered beauty, quiet rot, and the necessary end of all things.Their realm lies in shadowed glens and endless winters, but it is filled with harsh truth and strange kindness. They despise pretense and honor debt.Their Monarch: King Caerwend, of the Mirror-Snow, who sees all futures and speaks in forgotten tones. His court moves with the solemn grace of falling leaves.Of the Ninefold TricksterIf one being ever rivaled a god in cunning, it is the Ninefold Trickster—she of the burning tails and moonlit mischief.Many mistake her for a demon or spirit-queen from far Eastern myths, but she is as rooted in our world’s Dream as any Feylord. Her domain is neither Seelie nor Unseelie, but a secret Third Path: the Court of Echoes, hidden between breath and shadow.Powers: Illusion, Foxfire, Pact-weaving, Memory Theft.Terms: She offers arcane strength in exchange for secrets never spoken, stories never written, or clever service rendered with wit. She despises dull minds and boring souls.Warning: Never lie to her unless you intend for her to know you did.Pactcraft – The Delicate Art of Binding and BoonDo not be seduced by Faerie bargains. Their gifts are dazzling—but barbed.A Fey pact is not a mere contract. It is a song, a thread in the tapestry of one’s soul, and above all, a test. To accept a boon is to accept debt—and Fey memory does not fade.Forms of Pacts:Word-Bond: Spoken promises with symbolic gestures. Break it, and reality itself rebels.Mark-Binding: A rune or sigil branded to skin or spirit. The mark pulses when the pact is in jeopardy.Name-Gift: When a Fey gives or accepts a name, power shifts. Use or reveal such names with utmost caution.Known Boons:Speech with beastsImmunity to cold ironGlimpses of future echoesUnnatural beauty or charmEach gift has a cost: loyalty, labor, or an unknown truth paid forward.The Laws Beneath the LeavesThe Fey do not obey mortal law. They live by Principles, born of Onigod’s laughter and Tellemori’s breath: Balance Must Be Kept – Joy and grief, gift and price, glamour and decay. Names Are Power – Do not speak yours freely. Nor take one lightly. Promises Shape Fate – All vows are true in the Feywild. Glamour Reveals as Much as It Hides – See past the mask, and you may understand. Nothing Is Coincidence – The Fey notice everything. To walk in their realm is to accept wonder, but survive it only with wit and courtesy.Addendum: The Thorned CompassThe Thorned Compass is an artifact said to point not North, but to truth. Forged by a forgotten pact between Onigod and the Ninefold Trickster, it reveals the safest path through the Feywild only if one travels without deceit.I possessed it briefly. It sang to me in riddles.

To name them \"monsters\" would be mortal arrogance; they are older than our fears.The WhistlehartA deer-shaped creature with luminous antlers, soft humming breath, and the eyes of an old poet. If it allows you to follow it, you will find safety. If it watches from a distance, you are already lost.Tellemori’s Favored. They mourn silently when forests die.Thorn-MaresHorse-like fey born from broken oaths and forgotten promises. They gallop in silence, leaving trails of briar where they pass. Ride one only if you have no destination—and no fear of what you may become.Weakness: Bells, laughter, and honest answers.MurmurtreesTrees that whisper what they overhear. Their roots stretch between realms, feeding on secrets. Sit beneath them to learn—but never fall asleep, or you will dream another's life and forget your own.Banquets of Memory and MistDining among the Fey is ritual. Every bite may hold a story; every course, a test.The Rules of the Table Do Not Eat Unless Invited – To steal a taste is to bind your fate. Eat Only What You Understand – Some dishes are not for mortal minds. Some are not food at all. Share Your Story When Toasted – Refuse, and you will be forgotten by the host, and perhaps the world. A Seelie feast glimmers with seasonal fruits, glowing honey, and candied petals that shimmer in your mouth. An Unseelie banquet, by contrast, is somber: smoked rootmeats, chilled starlight, and shadow-wine that shows your regrets in its surface.It is said the Ninefold Trickster serves meals that taste like lost memories, with silverware that murmurs secrets if held to the ear.The Dream That HuntsFew speak of it. Fewer return.There is something deeper in the Feywild—older than Courts, cleverer than angels. It is known as the Dream That Hunts: a predator of unreal logic, drawn to broken stories, oathbreakers, and those who defy Fey law.It takes no form until it nears, and then becomes what you fear most.How to Evade It:Speak no lie.Break no rhythm in your steps.Carry a token from each Court (they argue too much to share prey).And most of all: do not call its name. Not even now.Those taken are not killed—they are erased. Not even the Murmurtrees remember them.Traveler’s Final WarningsIron Burns, but Honesty Slices Deeper – Fey admire cleverness, not cruelty. Do not confuse the two.Keep a Pocket Full of Small Truths – They make excellent trade.Never Thank Them – In their tongue, it means you owe a life-debt.The Moon May Speak to You – Listen. But answer only in rhyme.The Feywild is not a place—it is a pattern, a dream layered upon itself. If you walk its paths with respect, you may return wiser. If not… well. I suppose someone else will find your story.End of Volume III.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"realms/feywild/the-faerie-compendium/the-faerie-compendium-3.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057707145,"modifiedTime":1748385325019,"sourceSize":3136,"sourcePath":"Realms/Feywild/The Faerie Compendium/The Faerie Compendium 3.md","exportPath":"realms/feywild/the-faerie-compendium/the-faerie-compendium-3.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":33,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"realms/feywild/the-faerie-compendium/the-faerie-compendium-4.html":{"title":"The Faerie Compendium 4","icon":"","description":"The Faerie Codex, Vol. IV: Boundaries, Bloodlines, and the Mortal Knot\nPenned by Corbin Thorne, whose shadow still sometimes laughs without himWhere Realms BleedThe Feywild is not a world, but a reflection—bright where ours is dim, strange where ours is plain. It touches the mortal realm in subtle folds and sudden tears.Crossing PointsThese occur in places of beauty, sorrow, or wonder: a standing stone on a lonely moor, a tree blooming out of season, a forgotten well that sings. They appear most often:At dusk or dawnOn equinoxes, eclipses, or the Night of Silver EyesWhen music is played with true longingMortals rarely notice when they’ve crossed. The air grows sweeter. The shadows, slower. And sometimes, you hear your name whispered by something that isn’t there.Mortal-Fey BloodlinesUnions between fey and mortals are rare—but not unheard of. They leave behind changeling blood, a magic tangled in emotion and legacy.Traits of the TouchedUnaging eyesUnnatural charm or odd talentsDreams that sometimes walk ahead of themSome inherit glamours. Others, an innate bond with animals or storms. And a few… a dangerous knack for hearing things they shouldn’t.The Ninefold Trickster is said to have many such descendants, each marked by a glimmering tail-shaped birthmark and an irresistible urge to uncover secrets.The Mortal KnotThis is what fey call the deep binding that ties mortals to time, duty, and choice. They both envy and pity it.The Knot gives mortals:The ability to change destinyThe power to love only once and mean itThe pain of endings—and the strength to begin againFey cannot undo this knot. But they can tug at it. Twist it. Use it.Be Wary of These Bargains:Name-for-Name: Trading true names ties your soul to theirs for a cycle.Memory-for-Magic: Power is easy to gain; much harder to recall what you gave.Promise-for-Passage: Even forgotten promises bind.

Even kindness can be a hook.Do not love them expecting to be loved the same way.And if they give you a gift, bury it under moonlight before you open it.They do not hate us.

I did not claim it. I did not wish it.\nAnd yet—through one celestial jest and the utter failure of three divine beings to possess a single grain of mercy—I am now known by it in every tongue, prayer, and bardic tale.This farce began with Ioki, the Angel of Mischief, who found boredom in the upper planes and amusement in the desecration of my name.

They are born from humanity's dreams, fears, and forgotten stories, as well as from the deep magic of the earth itself.Though many call them by one name, \"fae\" encompasses a wide tapestry of beings—some elegant, others grotesque, and many neither. The Faerie are not evil, nor good, but bound by laws incomprehensible to most mortals. Their behavior is not chaotic, but ancient.Faeries see mortals as curiosities—ephemeral, tragic, beautiful in their impermanence. They may help, hinder, or steal from humans without remorse, but always with purpose.Chapter II: The Old Laws The Law of Hospitality\nA faerie who accepts shelter or offers it is bound by the rite of peace. Violence or betrayal under such conditions is a grave taboo, broken only by the most wild or corrupted spirits. The Law of Debt\nEvery gift carries weight. A song, a drop of blood, or a name may bind the receiver in unseen chains. Likewise, a faerie who accepts a mortal gift freely given may be compelled to offer aid, even without desire. The Law of Names\nTrue Names are sacred. Speaking a faerie's real name aloud grants power over them, as it binds their essence. Most fae go by titles or riddles instead. Mortals, too, are warned not to offer their full names in faerie company. The Law of Invitation\nA faerie must be invited to enter a home or cross a mortal threshold. This protection falters if the mortal speaks carelessly or welcomes them unknowingly. Chapter III: On Glamour and FormGlamour is not illusion, but belief made real. The fae shift form as easily as a mortal shifts moods. Their true shapes are rarely seen—some are luminous beings of light and air, others are moss-covered husks of forgotten forest gods.Mirrors, silver, and salt can reveal or disrupt glamour. True sight—granted by faerie blessing, curse, or trauma—allows mortals to see through lies of form.Chapter IV: The Courts and KithsThe Bright Court\nComposed of faeries bound to starlight, song, and beauty. These fae are graceful and formal, prone to tragic obsessions and artistic cruelty. They offer gifts of great beauty—but their favors are rarely free.The Hollow Court\nWild and eerie, bound to rot, twilight, and memory. They haunt forgotten roads, autumn woods, and places where sorrow lingers. They are more honest than their Bright cousins, but no less dangerous.The Deep Folk\nAncient and primal, neither good nor evil. Born of stone, time, and darkness. They rarely speak, but their will can be felt in earthquakes, ruins, and dreams. They are worshipped by some as old gods.Other known kiths include:Selkies – Shapeshifters of sea and shore, who shed their skins to walk as humans.Leanan Sidhe – Muses who gift inspiration and drain life.Dullahans – Headless riders who herald death but can bargain for mercy.The Cats of Cailleach – Feline fae who guard sacred places and ferry the souls of the dead.Chapter V: High Fey and Divine PatronsThe Feywild is not without structure. Above the courts and kiths are the Archfey—ancient beings of near-divine power who shape entire realms with a thought. Chief among these is the Ninefold Trickster, an enigmatic fox spirit whose domain spans fire, illusion, and dominance.The Ninefold TricksterAppearance: A radiant, many-tailed fox spirit cloaked in living fire and silken charm. Her nine tails shimmer with colors not found in mortal light.Domains: Illusion, Fire, Stories, and Secret BargainsSymbols: A burning fox mask or nine curling flames arranged in a spiralThe Ninefold Trickster is said to have been born when Onigod first laughed upon seeing her own reflection in a fox’s eyes. Ever since, this archfey has ruled a shimmering province of the Feywild, where paths bend, fire sings, and secrets bloom like flowers.She is both patron and predator—offering power in exchange for clever service, binding pacts with riddles and fire. Her foxfire burns truth into lies and lies into truth. Many mages, bards, and tricksters trace their arcane lineage to a whispered deal struck at her feet.Chapter VI: Divine Powers of the FeywildThe Divine Heart of the Feywild is sustained by two primal beings:Tellemori – The Dreaming DepthGod of earth, water, and superstition.Slow-moving, ancient, wise beyond reckoning.Title: The RootfatherSymbol: Circle of water within a circle of stoneOnigod – The Laughing VeilGoddess of illusion, arcana, and inspired madness.Whimsical and brilliant, weaving stories into magic.Title: The Mirror-MotherSymbol: A smiling eye within a spiralThey are not in conflict, but eternal partners in contrast—like rain and rainbow, cave and song. From their union of opposites, the Feywild was born.Chapter VII: Angels of the Feywild CourtThe Lady of Fey (Twilight Queen)Angel of Tellemori; steward of order, memory, and story.Plantios (The Rooted Flame)Angel of flora and natural decay, nurturing cycles of death and renewal.Ioki (The Laughing Glyph)Angel of Onigod; shapeshifter and embodiment of trickery.Said to be the divine twin-soul of the Ninefold Trickster; both lover and rival.Chapter VIII: Tellu-Mountain and the Celestial RealmsAt the center of the Feywild stands Tellu-Mountain, a divine palace born of paradoxes:The Deepheart Cavern – Where Tellemori sleeps.The Bloomspire – Plantios’s spiraling garden tower.The Mirrorhall – The Lady of Fey's domain.The Foxlight Pavilion – Realm of Ioki and frequent haunt of the Ninefold Trickster.The Spiral Maze – Onigod’s endless temple of riddles.To walk Tellu-Mountain is to walk through living metaphor. Each step is a lesson. Each door opens when the seeker becomes the question.Final Word: Beware and Be KindThe fae are not monsters. They are wild, wondrous, and ancient. Treat them as you would a thunderstorm, or the sea: with respect, caution, and awe. Offer gifts without pride. Accept gifts with care. And never, ever forget the Old Laws.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"realms/feywild/lorebook-fae.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057707136,"modifiedTime":1748385324855,"sourceSize":6356,"sourcePath":"Realms/Feywild/Lorebook fae.md","exportPath":"realms/feywild/lorebook-fae.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":37,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"realms/feywild/lorebook-fae-2.html":{"title":"Lorebook fae 2","icon":"","description":"The Hidden Folk: A Lorebook of the Fae\nDrawn from the Whispered Histories of the Isles and the Observations of Ancient MagiPrologue: Whispers Beneath the BoughsThere are those who say the Feywild is but a dream of the world, an echo spun from moonlight and memory. But those who have walked too far into old woods, or followed a melody they could not hear with their ears, know otherwise. The fae are real. They are as real as grief, as joy, as the gleam in a liar’s eye. And among them walk beings older than time’s bones.The Weaving of the WorldBefore the first mortal tongue gave name to flame or stone, there were two who danced in the dark. Tellemori, the Rootfather, was the first to dream—not with thought, but with depth: stillness that sang, rivers that remembered. And Onigod, the Laughing Veil, was the first to laugh. Her joy scattered light into shadow, shadow into shape, and filled the empty with meaning.From their communion, the Feywild was born—not as a place of dominion, but a realm of contrast, where every truth holds a twin.They did not build a kingdom. They painted a riddle across the skin of the world.Of Archfey and Hidden ThronesAmid this wild canvas dwell the Archfey—shapers, not rulers, whose will becomes law only because the land itself listens. One such presence, whispered of in every burned offering and misremembered tale, is the Ninefold Trickster.They say she was born not of love or strife, but from a secret—Onigod’s first secret, whispered into the heart of a fox. That fox caught fire and laughter, and from its nine tails was spun a spirit who could never be caught, never be caged.The Ninefold Trickster dances where fire meets shadow. Her court is a forest that burns without ash, a palace of shifting silk and mirrored eyes. She does not demand devotion. She invites wagers, trades, stories. A mortal who enters her domain with a truth wrapped in a lie may leave with power beyond reckoning—or not at all.Those who meet her speak of foxfire that sings, of riddles carved in smoke, of lips that smile even when the mask is still. Her magic is beautiful. Her magic is cruel. She does not love, but she is fond. And that fondness has rewritten many fates.Some call her patron. Others, peril. She calls herself a listener of secrets—and a collector of debts.Tellu-Mountain and the Harmony DivineAll things in the Feywild spiral back to Tellu-Mountain, the dreaming body of the Rootfather and the mirrored mind of the Laughing Veil. Its slopes are not climbed but understood. Each realm within is a breath of their will:The Deepheart Cavern, where Tellemori hums lullabies older than stars.The Spiral Maze, where Onigod’s questions chase their own tails.The Foxlight Pavilion, where the Trickster’s steps leave trails of fireflies and forgotten names.Angels dwell here too—not as soldiers, but stewards. The Twilight Queen weaves the memory of every pact ever made. Plantios walks slowly, yet every step births a bloom or a rot. And Ioki, that sacred chaos in a mask of laughter, is perhaps the Trickster’s only equal—or is it her shadow?Legends say the Ninefold Trickster and Ioki have danced a thousand games and kissed in a thousand guises. Are they one soul split by a trick? Or rivals who love too deeply to win?No answer is ever final in the Feywild.On Mortal Threads in the TapestryMortals often wonder why the fae meddle in their lives. The truth is not cruelty, nor boredom, but curiosity. You are short-lived, yes—but you make meaning with every breath. And the fae, for all their power, are ever hungry for meaning.To the Ninefold Trickster, a mortal’s secret is a delicacy. A clever lie, a heartfelt vow, a sacrifice made in laughter—these are currencies more precious than gold. She has given fire to those who offered riddles. She has granted names to those who gave up their own.But beware: her gifts are always mirrors. They show you who you are… and who you might have been, if only you had chosen differently.Closing Thought: The Candle and the FlameThe Feywild is not a kingdom. It is a story told by gods who do not speak plainly. To walk its paths is to read poetry written in weather, to hear songs hummed by roots.So remember this: the Ninefold Trickster listens when you lie with cleverness. She watches when you gamble your heart. And sometimes, just sometimes, she will answer.But only if your story is worth stealing.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"realms/feywild/lorebook-fae-2.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057707135,"modifiedTime":1748385324905,"sourceSize":4517,"sourcePath":"Realms/Feywild/Lorebook fae 2.md","exportPath":"realms/feywild/lorebook-fae-2.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":38,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"realms/feywild/the-divine-heart-of-the-feywild.html":{"title":"The Divine Heart of the Feywild","icon":"","description":"While the Feywild is ruled by wild magic and intense emotion, its foundation is shaped by two divine beings: the ancient dreamer Tellemori, god of earth, water, and superstition, and the radiant trickster Onigod, goddess of arcana, illusion, and mischief.These two gods are not lovers, rivals, or opposites—but rather perfect complements, like river and reflection, or root and lightning. Together, they dreamed the Feywild into being: Tellemori wove its natural soul, and Onigod filled it with wonder, color, and chaos.Though war exists in the mortal and outer realms, the gods themselves never fight. The divine are bound by ancient concord, and the Feywild is the purest result of that harmony—chaotic in form, but peaceful in purpose.Tellemori is the god of earth, water, superstition, and the old magic beneath all things. He is the stillness before a storm, the rhythm of tides, the whisper of roots beneath your feet. He does not rule with commands or fury—but with patience, presence, and inevitability.He is not cold or distant. He simply moves slowly, like stone eroding or rivers carving through mountains. Those who listen find his wisdom in lullabies, folk sayings, and the quiet between breaths.He is not a god of temples or gold, but of rings of stones, cups of spring water, and children's rhymes repeated across generations.Title: The Rootfather, Stone-Sleeper, the Dreaming DepthDomains: Earth, Water, Superstition, EnduranceSymbol: A circle of water within a circle of stoneKnown For: Unshakable peace; he sees the long path, not the immediate victory.Where Onigod skips between laughter and lightning, Tellemori simply waits, watches, and grows. And yet—he is deeply fond of her. Her unpredictability does not disturb him; it amuses him, as waves amuse the shoreline.Together, they created the Feywild not as ruler and rebel, but as co-artists. Where Onigod gave it color, Tellemori gave it shape. Where she gave whimsy, he gave memory.It is said that when she teases him, he only smiles—that slow, knowing smile of the earth that cannot be rushed.Onigod is the goddess of arcane artistry, riddles, mischief, and inspired madness. She is the spark behind every strange coincidence, every spell that reshapes the world, every joke that opens the mind. Where Tellemori built the bones of the Feywild, Onigod taught it to dance.She is adored by trickster spirits, illusionists, fey pranksters, and clever sages. Her joy is in the unexpected, and she is said to play pranks on other gods—not out of malice, but to remind them not to take eternity too seriously.Her laughter is woven into the Feywild's magic itself. Every playful trick, every strange forest rule, every mischievous bargain the fey make—it all flows from her.Title: The Laughing Veil, the Mirror-MotherDomains: Arcana, Trickery, Discovery, MysterySymbol: A smiling eye within a spiralKnown For: Speaking only in layered truths; playing tricks even on her worshipers to teach them insight.She dwells within Tellu-Mountain, not in chambers of stone, but in a shifting arcane maze that rewrites itself each day. Her presence brings starlight, songbirds, and inexplicable riddles.Four powerful angels serve or dwell among the gods of the Feywild:Angel of Tellemori and steward of order in a land of chaos. She ensures rules are obeyed, debts honored, and names remembered. She is grace, courtesy, and veiled power.Title: The Twilight QueenDomain: Emotion, Glamour, StorySymbol: A mirrored mask with open lipsTellemori’s angel of flora, growth, and inevitable renewal. His slow gaze can end an age or nurture a forest. He speaks rarely, but with the gravity of seasons.Title: The Rooted FlameDomain: Seasons, Renewal, DecaySymbol: A burning blossom cupped in leavesAngel of Onigod, and her finest piece of living mischief. Ioki is the divine clown, sage, shapeshifter, and chaos-binder. Though not Tellemori’s angel, Ioki dwells permanently in the Feywild, often seen as the heart of its trickster spirit.Their bond with the Lady of Fey is legendary: lovers, rivals, mirror-souls—no one is quite sure, least of all the two of them.Title: The Mask Between, the Laughing GlyphDomain: Trickery, Arcana, ChangeSymbol: A spiral of laughing mouths inside a magic circleTellu-Mountain: The Living Divine PalaceAt the spiritual center of the Feywild rises Tellu-Mountain, a vast, living mountain whose peak touches the edge of dreams and whose roots burrow into every realm of magic. It is home to Tellemori, Onigod, and their angelic court.It is not a fortress—it does not need walls. Its protection is harmony, mystery, and deep magic. It is a palace of paradoxes: ever-shifting, yet eternal.The Deepheart Cavern – Where Tellemori sleeps and breathes. Silence lives here.The Bloomspire – Plantios’s tower of spiraling vines, always blooming and withering.The Mirrorhall – Lady of Fey’s domain, where every reflection reveals truth and history.The Foxlight Pavilion – Ioki’s realm of light, shadow, laughter, and confusion.The Spiral Maze – Onigod’s shifting temple, where answers only come when questions are asked backward.Visitors to Tellu-Mountain must answer riddles, sing to trees, or give their names to shadows. Those who try to take from it find themselves gently unmade and remade as something new.Though war rages in mortal lands, and power shifts among kings and cults, the divine realms are held in balance. The gods do not fight; their angels do not fall. They create, nudge, inspire, and redirect.The Feywild reflects this cosmic truth: that even chaos can serve peace, and that beauty and mystery are forces as strong as fire and steel.The fey do not fight for conquest. They trick, tempt, confuse, and enchant—for such things, born of Onigod’s laughter and Tellemori’s dreaming, always teach.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>The Divine Heart of the Feywild: Tellemori, Onigod, and Their Celestial Stewards</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Divine_Heart_of_the_Feywild_Tellemori,_Onigod,_and_Their_Celestial_Stewards**_0"},{"heading":"Tellemori – The Rootfather, the Dreaming Depth","level":3,"id":"Tellemori_–_The_Rootfather,_the_Dreaming_Depth_0"},{"heading":"Onigod – The Laughing Veil, Mistress of Twisting Paths","level":3,"id":"Onigod_–_The_Laughing_Veil,_Mistress_of_Twisting_Paths_0"},{"heading":"The Angels of the Feywild Court","level":3,"id":"The_Angels_of_the_Feywild_Court_0"},{"heading":"The Lady of Fey","level":4,"id":"The_Lady_of_Fey_0"},{"heading":"Plantios","level":4,"id":"Plantios_0"},{"heading":"Ioki","level":4,"id":"Ioki_0"},{"heading":"Divine Harmony, Mortal Struggle","level":3,"id":"Divine_Harmony,_Mortal_Struggle_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"realms/feywild/the-divine-heart-of-the-feywild.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057707138,"modifiedTime":1747516294776,"sourceSize":6299,"sourcePath":"Realms/Feywild/The Divine Heart of the Feywild.md","exportPath":"realms/feywild/the-divine-heart-of-the-feywild.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":39,"backlinks":["the-tapestry.html"],"type":"markdown"},"realms/feywild/the-feywilds.html":{"title":"The feywilds","icon":"","description":"As compiled by Archsage Maerindor of the Verdant CircleBeyond the veil of the Material World lies a realm not bound by the laws of logic or time. A place of living dream, endless twilight, and primal magic. This is the Feywild—called Elatha by the elves, The Brightlands by druids, and simply the Green World by those wise enough to speak of it in hushed tones.The Feywild is not just another plane of existence. It is the soul of the natural world, shaped by memory, emotion, and belief. Here, feelings shape the land. Music can tame beasts. And the wrong word may cost your name.The Feywild mirrors the Material Plane, but its features are exaggerated. Forests are older, skies more colorful, rivers sing, and even shadows shimmer with life. A village in the mortal realm might be echoed in the Feywild as a grove of sentient trees, or a mist-covered ruin ruled by a dreaming spirit.In the Feywild, emotion is a force as real as gravity or fire. A lover’s sorrow might cause the moon to weep rain; a child’s joy may cause flowers to bloom out of season. Powerful fey can shape the world through sheer will and feeling.Words hold power in the Feywild. Promises are binding. Lies are dangerous. To say “I will return” is to make a contract. The fey do not forgive those who break their word, whether through malice or carelessness.Time does not move predictably in the Feywild. A traveler might spend a day in its woods and return to find a century passed—or discover no time passed at all. Likewise, memory itself can warp. Mortals who stay too long may forget their past, their name, or even their purpose.Passage to the Feywild is not undertaken lightly. While powerful magic can open portals, natural crossings are far more common—and far less predictable. These Fey Crossings often appear:\nWhere natural beauty thrives: groves, waterfalls, standing stones.\nAt liminal times: dawn, dusk, solstices, eclipses.\nDuring moments of strong emotion: love, fear, grief.\nExiting the Feywild can be much harder—some are trapped for lifetimes unless aided by a native or protected by fey magic.Ruled by Queen Titania, the Seelie Court embodies growth, passion, light, and creativity. Its fey are proud, beautiful, and often helpful—though quick to anger or offense.\nValues: Hospitality, honor, artistry, respect.\nCommon Creatures: Eladrin, dryads, unicorns, satyrs, noble faeries.\nWarning: To disrespect a Seelie is to invite eternal scorn... or be transformed into a songbird for a hundred years.\nThe Queen of Air and Darkness leads the Unseelie—fey of shadow, sorrow, and forgotten things. They do not claim to be evil, only true to the balance of life: decay follows growth, loss follows joy.\nValues: Freedom, cunning, change, retribution.\nCommon Creatures: Hags, redcaps, boggles, shadow spirits, sorrow sprites.\nWarning: The Unseelie always keep their bargains. You may not like how.\nA rare and elusive third court said to seek balance between light and shadow. Its members are quiet stewards of fate and memory, intervening only to preserve the greater weave of destiny.\nLeader: The Masked One, whose name is lost.\nRole: Observers, arbiters, oracles. Eladrin: Elves infused with seasonal magic. Their mood and power shift with the seasons.\nPixies &amp; Sprites: Tiny winged fey known for their pranks and charm magic.\nHags: Once noble fey, now corrupted by greed and bitterness. Masters of curses and deals.\nDryads &amp; Naiads: Spirits bound to trees, rivers, and natural features. Harm their home, and you risk their wrath.\nArchfey: Semi-divine beings of immense power—rulers, legends, and walking myths. Some grant warlocks power, others seek mortal champions.\nTalking Animals: Many animals here are intelligent and fey-touched. Never assume a fox is just a fox. Be respectful. Courtesy is currency.\nOffer gifts to those you meet—tokens, songs, poetry, or favors.\nAsk permission before entering a grove, plucking a flower, or drinking from a stream. Never break a promise.\nDon’t accept food or drink without knowing the cost.\nAvoid giving your true name. Names are power in the Feywild.\nDon’t mock the strange—what seems silly may be sacred. Memory Drift: Long stays may cause memories to fade or be altered.\nTime Displacement: Use a d6 to determine time passed in the Material Plane upon return.\nMood Manifestation: Intense emotions may cause magic surges, environmental changes, or draw attention from local fey.\nDream Influence: Dreams may carry visions from the Feywild or open portals during sleep. You were raised by fey and recently exiled or released.\nYou made a childhood bargain you don’t remember—but the fey do.\nA loved one vanished into the Feywild, and you seek them.\nYou carry a fey mark—sign of a destiny not fully your own.\nThe Feywild is not evil. Nor is it good. It is a realm of feeling and story. Of promises, riddles, and beauty too terrible to behold. Treat it with awe, and it may reveal its wonders. Offend it, and you may become one more tale whispered around the fire.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>The Feywild: A Guide to the Realm of the Fae</strong>","level":1,"id":"**The_Feywild_A_Guide_to_the_Realm_of_the_Fae**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Introduction</strong>","level":2,"id":"**Introduction**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Nature of the Feywild</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Nature_of_the_Feywild**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Mirrored, Yet Wild</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Mirrored,_Yet_Wild**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Emotion as Power</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Emotion_as_Power**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Rule of Words</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Rule_of_Words**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Time and Memory</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Time_and_Memory**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Getting There—and Back</strong>","level":2,"id":"**Getting_There—and_Back**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Fey Courts</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Fey_Courts**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Seelie Court (The Court of Summer)</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Seelie_Court_(The_Court_of_Summer)**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Unseelie Court (The Court of Winter)</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Unseelie_Court_(The_Court_of_Winter)**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Gloaming Concord (Court of Twilight)</strong> <em>(optional)</em>","level":3,"id":"**The_Gloaming_Concord_(Court_of_Twilight)**_(optional)__0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Inhabitants of the Feywild</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Inhabitants_of_the_Feywild**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Laws of the Land</strong>","level":2,"id":"**Laws_of_the_Land**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Do’s</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Do’s**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Don’ts</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Don’ts**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Feywild Effects on Players</strong>","level":2,"id":"**Feywild_Effects_on_Players**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Adventure Hooks for Players</strong>","level":2,"id":"**Adventure_Hooks_for_Players**_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"realms/feywild/the-feywilds.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057707139,"modifiedTime":1747516294742,"sourceSize":5888,"sourcePath":"Realms/Feywild/The feywilds.md","exportPath":"realms/feywild/the-feywilds.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":40,"backlinks":["the-tapestry.html"],"type":"markdown"},"realms/fiondell/demre-stade.html":{"title":"Demre Stade","icon":"","description":"\nDemre Stade is a kingdom located at the south half of the great west iland.

Fiondell is the central world of The Tapestry, the grand creation woven by the Five Gods of Creation. Named after Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind, and order, Fiondell is a vibrant, living world where divine power flows freely and mortal destinies unfold. This is a realm where swords clash, magic pulses, and the presence of gods and angels is deeply felt.The Five Gods fashioned Fiondell as their masterpiece—a world rich with life, conflict, and endless stories. The gods rarely walk openly here, but their angels watch over the lands, guiding, protecting, and sometimes testing those who dwell below.\nFiondell is a terrestrial planet with sprawling continents, vast oceans, and a varied climate—from frozen tundras to scorching deserts. Magic is a natural force here, drawn from the weave of the cosmos and influenced by the god Onigod’s arcane design. Mortal cultures vary widely across continents—some embrace magic openly, while others thrive on technology or strict military order. The land itself bears scars of divine influence and ancient conflict: ruins of fallen empires, sacred ley lines, and places where the void’s dark whispers linger. Celestial relics and artifacts of great power are hidden across the world, remnants of the gods’ handiwork and past battles. Fiondell is divided into many continents, each unique in culture, geography, and divine oversight. Some are fully mapped, others remain mysteries, and a few are shrouded in legend.Discovered during the Age of Water by the human prince Demre Brassleaf, Varlen Brassleaf proved the world held more land beyond the familiar seas.\nVarlen Brassleaf is a continent where swords and magic intertwine. Before humans arrived, it was home to elves, dwarfs, orcs, and halflings. Over time, humans and others migrated here, weaving a diverse and often tense tapestry of races and cultures.\nThe continent’s cities reflect this diversity and history:\nDemre Stade: Founded and declared an independent kingdom by Stade Brassleaf, son of Demre, at the close of the Age of Water. Elven Forest: Ancient and fiercely protected by elves, the forest has stood since before the Age of Water and remains a place few outsiders enter. Fishy Elifodep: A multicultural city created during the Age of Plants, intended as a haven for all races. Med é Vill: A tribal orc stronghold known for its love of battle, predating the Age of Water. Rapt Orlando: A halfling city famed for its peaceful nature and lack of violence. Tinn Vill: The dwarven city centered on the continent’s only mine, where most dwarfs live beneath the earth. Frostmá: A deadly island overrun by beasts and ruin. Each city venerates its own interpretation of The Tapestry, reflecting the continent’s spiritual diversity.\nA small, industrial continent shaped by steampunk technology and innovation. Only humans and elves live here, and they deny the existence of magic and other supernatural beings, though they unknowingly channel arcane energies to power their machines and inventions.A remote volcanic island inhabited solely by dragons and isolated dragonborn clans. The island is fiercely protected and governed by Drana, Archangel of Dragons, who also serves as the angel of war due to her fierce temperament.Khorvaire is a land defined by constant conflict, strategy, and power struggles.\nThe primary angels overseeing this continent are Destiny and Drana. Drana’s role as the angel of war deeply influences Khorvaire’s endless battles and volatile politics. Contrary to earlier accounts, Prai has no connection to Khorvaire. Fiondell is more than a world—it is a living stage for the ongoing interplay of divine will, mortal courage, and cosmic mystery. The gods rarely intervene directly but influence the world through angels, relics, and the fates they weave.\nThe Five Gods’ presence is often felt but seldom seen. Angels act as guides, protectors, or challengers for the peoples below. Heroes of Fiondell shape the fate of continents, uncover divine secrets, and battle the creeping darkness left by the Voidbringer. “In Fiondell, every leaf carries a story, every mountain holds a memory, and every soul is a thread in the great Tapestry of existence. The gods weave not only worlds but destinies.”\n— Known, Angel of Knowledge\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>Fiondell — The Living World of the Tapestry</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Fiondell_—_The_Living_World_of_the_Tapestry**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Nature of Fiondell</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Nature_of_Fiondell**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Continents of Fiondell</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Continents_of_Fiondell**_0"},{"heading":"<strong><a data-href=\"Varlen Brassleaf\" href=\"Varlen Brassleaf\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Varlen Brassleaf</a></strong>","level":4,"id":"**[[Varlen_Brassleaf]]**_0"},{"heading":"<strong><a data-href=\"Xeímor\" href=\"Xeímor\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Xeímor</a></strong>","level":4,"id":"**[[Xeímor]]**_0"},{"heading":"<strong><a data-href=\"Dragoné, Island of dragons\" href=\"Dragoné, Island of dragons\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dragoné, Island of dragons</a></strong>","level":4,"id":"**[[Dragoné,_Island_of_dragons]]**_0"},{"heading":"<strong><a data-href=\"Khorvaire\" href=\"Khorvaire\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Khorvaire</a> — The Military Continent</strong>","level":4,"id":"**[[Khorvaire]]_—_The_Military_Continent**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Unnamed Continents</strong>","level":4,"id":"**Unnamed_Continents**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Fiondell’s Role in the Cosmos</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Fiondell’s_Role_in_the_Cosmos**_0"}],"links":["the-tapestry.html",".html","angels/angels.html","realms/fiondell/varlen-brassleaf.html","realms/fiondell/xeímor.html","realms/fiondell/dragoné,-island-of-dragons.html",".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"realms/fiondell/fiondell.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057707155,"modifiedTime":1747524362959,"sourceSize":5131,"sourcePath":"Realms/Fiondell/Fiondell.md","exportPath":"realms/fiondell/fiondell.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":44,"backlinks":["angels/angels.html","kryxis.html","realms/fiondell/varlen-brassleaf.html","realms/fiondell/xeímor.html","the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-appointing-of-day,-night,-and-mr.-season.html","the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-banishment-of-the-voidbringer.html","the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-rise-of-the-holy-knights.html","the-tapestry.html","welcome.html"],"type":"markdown"},"realms/fiondell/varlen-brassleaf.html":{"title":"Varlen Brassleaf","icon":"","description":"Varlen Brassleaf was discovered and found in the <a data-href=\"Age of water\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Age of water</a> by the Human prince called <a data-href=\"Demre Brassleaf\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Demre Brassleaf</a>.

It is timeless and weightless, where stillness reigns and thought echoes. This is the divine realm of Flujack, god of Air, Sky, and Light, and the celestial home of his angels.Though it appears peaceful and without danger, the Plane of Reflection hides great challenges for mortal minds—especially within its most guarded sanctum.The entire plane consists of nothing but air. There is no land, no water, no floor—only boundless sky. Drifting islands of cloud and radiant sunbeams break the monotony, but the space stretches forever in every direction.Suspended in the very center of this void are two structures: the Sanctum of Sky, and the Vault of Stilllight.A majestic, floating palace woven of radiant air, clear crystal, and glimmering light. The Sanctum of Sky is the domain of Flujack and his celestial court of angels. The architecture constantly shifts, bending like wind-blown fabric.\nFlujack spends most of his time asleep atop a vast bed of cloudfeathers and gentle air currents. His dreams shape the winds and light of the mortal realm. Despite his slumber, his will is powerful, and he communicates through dreams, breezes, and celestial signs. The sanctum is quiet and serene, watched over by his angels, who maintain the delicate balance of air, light, and change. Each angel resides in a chamber reflecting their domain:\nSky, Angel of Air – Dwells within whirling vortexes of endless currents. Day, Angel of Light – Resides in a sunlit prism chamber that never dims. Night, Angel of Darkness – Keeps a quiet room filled with false stars and hushed thoughts. Mr. Season, Angel of Seasons – Lives in a rotating chamber of changing weather and flora. Sandman, Angel of Slumber – Dreams eternally in a drifting room of fog and whispering sleep. The second structure, a towering silver spire suspended by nothing, is known as the Vault of Stilllight. It serves two divine purposes:\nThe celestial gateway to and from the Plane of Reflection.\nA trial of soul and mind, used to guard powerful relics forged by gods and sealed away from the mortal realm.\nAt its summit is a shimmering mirror portal that serves as the only stable path to this plane. Only those chosen or summoned by divine beings may pass.Beneath the gate lies the heart of the Vault—a psychic dungeon unlike any other. This is not a trial of might or magic, but of mind, memory, and soul.\nEach challenger faces their deepest fears, regrets, shames, failures, and hidden weaknesses, manifested through powerful illusions and divine constructs. The vault is designed not to defeat the body, but to break the spirit. Time may feel endless within its depths, and each room can isolate challengers within their own minds. Those who endure the entire trial are judged worthy, and may claim a divine relic sealed within. These relics are fragments of divine essence—tools too dangerous, too sacred, or too world-shifting to be left unchecked. Many heroes enter. Few emerge whole. But those who succeed often leave changed, bearing celestial artifacts capable of reshaping fate.The Plane of Reflection is the sacred pause between cosmic breaths. It is:\nA place of divine rest, where air and thought flow freely. A trial of soul, designed to purify and temper mortal ambition. A vault of forgotten power, where the gods store their most perilous creations. It reminds all that true change begins within, and that peace is not the absence of struggle, but the stillness found beyond it.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>PLANE OF REFLECTION</strong>","level":1,"id":"**PLANE_OF_REFLECTION**_0"},{"heading":"<em>The Sky Beyond the World, the Resting Realm of Light and Air</em>","level":2,"id":"_The_Sky_Beyond_the_World,_the_Resting_Realm_of_Light_and_Air__0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Sky Without Ground</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Sky_Without_Ground**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Sanctum of Sky – Home of Flujack and His Angels</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Sanctum_of_Sky_–_Home_of_Flujack_and_His_Angels**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Vault of Stilllight – The Gate and the Trial of Reflection</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Vault_of_Stilllight_–_The_Gate_and_the_Trial_of_Reflection**_0"},{"heading":"🌀 <strong>The Gate</strong>","level":3,"id":"🌀_**The_Gate**_0"},{"heading":"🔮 <strong>The Trial of Reflection</strong>","level":3,"id":"🔮_**The_Trial_of_Reflection**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Purpose and Power</strong>","level":2,"id":"**Purpose_and_Power**_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"realms/plane-of-reflection/plane-of-reflection.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057707160,"modifiedTime":1747523224560,"sourceSize":4259,"sourcePath":"Realms/Plane of Reflection/Plane of reflection.md","exportPath":"realms/plane-of-reflection/plane-of-reflection.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":48,"backlinks":["the-tapestry.html"],"type":"markdown"},"realms/plane-of-the-gods/plane-of-the-gods.html":{"title":"Plane of the Gods","icon":"","description":"Above all realms, far from mortal suffering, lies the Plane of the Gods—the eternal heaven, a realm of balance, memory, and celestial purpose. It is not a place of conflict or reward, but of origin, intention, and creation. Here, the threads of all reality—the Tapestry—are seen clearly, and all who reside here know their part in its weave.The Tapestry is the eternal weave of existence itself: time, space, matter, emotion, soul, and story. It was born from the gods’ will, shaped by their angels, and colored by the lives of mortals. The Plane of the Gods is the spiritual core of the Tapestry, where all threads converge and are watched over with infinite care.Five gods created the Tapestry and shaped its infinite strands. Of these, Fionil and Trill reside in the Plane of the Gods, maintaining harmony and overseeing the vast workings of existence.\nFionil, goddess of Time, Space, Mind, and Order, the highest of the gods. She weaves structure into chaos and brings clarity to thought and form. Trill, god of Life, Death, Divinity, and Dragons, whose breath kindled the soul and whose hand shaped mortality and rebirth. The other gods—Onigod (Arcane, Monsters, and Magic), Tellemori (Water, Earth, and the Supernatural), and Flujack (Air, Sky, and Light)—reside in their own realms but appear frequently in the Celestial Court.At the center of Heaven lies the Celestial Court, a radiant structure of luminous crystal and divine light. It is the seat of divine governance, reflection, and purpose. All that occurs in the Tapestry is reflected here.This grand chamber contains six thrones:\nFionil, Trill, Onigod, Tellemori, and Flujack each have their names carved in sacred runes upon their seats. The sixth throne bears no name, a smooth stone meant for Destiny, the Angel of Fate—should he ever accept godhood. Though it is offered, he eternally refuses. Surrounding the thrones are twenty-five golden lecterns, one for each of the Angels of Heaven—those who reside in the Court and those who serve across realms.Angels are powerful celestial beings created by the gods to carry out their will. Each has a domain, and most are immortal caretakers of specific realms or forces.These angels live within Heaven and tend its halls, the Library, the Gatehall, or serve directly under Fionil and Trill:\nKnown, Angel of Knowledge – Curator of the endless Library. Livius, Angel of Life – Judges the newly dead and grants reincarnation or rest. Willia, Angel of Will – Brings autonomy to mortal and divine will. Filla, Angel of Feelings – Gives emotion to creatures. Prai, Angel of Worship – Voice between mortals and gods. Fionil’s Angels (excluding those in other realms): Clock, Known, Willia, Filla. Trill’s Angels (excluding Lucina, Death, Drana): Livius, Prai. These angels often remain within Heaven unless summoned.These angels govern domains in Feywild, Damnation, or elsewhere in the Tapestry:\nLucina, Angel of Damnation – Ruler of Damnation, Sin of Pride. Cupin, Angel of Sin (female) – Interferes with the balance of morality. Death, Angel of Passing – Guides the dead. Drana, Archangel of Dragons – Overseer of dragons and war. Ignarion, the Firefather – First dragon, not an angel but a primordial celestial. Serapth (Sera) – Daughter of Destiny, a divergent angel. Lady of Fey, Angel of Fey – Overseer of the fey courts. Plantios, Angel of Flora – Maintains the cycle of plant life. Lady Love, Angel of Affection – Encourages bonds and creation. Destiny, Archangel of Fate – Master of fate; dwells between time and space. Clock, Angel of Time – Keeps time stable within the Time Stream. Sky, Angel of Air – Governs winds and skies. Day, Angel of Light – Bringer of light since Lucina’s descent. Night, Angel of Darkness – Guardian of calm and introspection. Mr. Season, Angel of Seasons – Shapes seasonal cycles. Sandman, Angel of Slumber – Induces sleep across the realms. Poki, Angel of Monsters and Beasts – Protector of monstrous beings. Arcna, Angel of the Arcane – Regulates magical essence. Undean, Angel of the Undead – Prevents spiritual corruption. Loki, Angel of Mischief – Created for Onigod’s amusement, spreader of chaos. Tended by Known, the Angel of Knowledge, the Library holds all knowledge ever recorded. The books write themselves, updated with every action in the Tapestry. It is a place of inquiry, not worship—a sacred archive of mortal and divine truth.A sacred chamber containing the divine portals. It is here where angels and gods may traverse to other realms, and mortals—very rarely—are permitted entrance under divine judgment or invitation.Here, Livius judges the souls of the dead. If worthy, they may rest in the Heavenly Expanse—a peaceful realm of endless dreamscapes. If ready, they may request rebirth, rejoining the cycle of life with echoes of their former soul.Those who are corrupted, tormented, or judged too dangerous are sent, with regret, to Damnation.Beyond the Celestial Court lies endless Heaven, a world of beauty shaped by the souls who enter it. Each spirit creates their paradise, and when ready, returns to the Chamber of Renewal to begin again.There is no war in Heaven. The angels carry small rivalries, old grudges, and contrasting philosophies—but never conflict. Gods do not war. Their focus is on the balance of the Tapestry.In Heaven, all things serve a greater design. Change is welcome. Knowledge is treasured. Rebirth is sacred. And the gods sit not above, but within the Tapestry, as its weavers, watchers, and wardens.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>PLANE OF THE GODS</strong>","level":1,"id":"**PLANE_OF_THE_GODS**_0"},{"heading":"<em>Heaven – The Divine Loom of the Tapestry</em>","level":2,"id":"_Heaven_–_The_Divine_Loom_of_the_Tapestry__0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Tapestry – That Which Is All</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Tapestry_–_That_Which_Is_All**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Gods of Heaven</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Gods_of_Heaven**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Celestial Court – Heart of Heaven</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Celestial_Court_–_Heart_of_Heaven**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Throne Hall – The Six Seats of the Gods</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Throne_Hall_–_The_Six_Seats_of_the_Gods**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Angels of the Divine</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Angels_of_the_Divine**_0"},{"heading":"🏛️ <strong>Angels Who Reside in the Celestial Court</strong>","level":3,"id":"🏛️_**Angels_Who_Reside_in_the_Celestial_Court**_0"},{"heading":"✨ <strong>Angels Who Dwell in Other Realms</strong>","level":3,"id":"✨_**Angels_Who_Dwell_in_Other_Realms**_0"},{"heading":"🔥 <strong>Damnation (Hell)</strong>","level":4,"id":"🔥_**Damnation_(Hell)**_0"},{"heading":"🍃 <strong>Feywild</strong>","level":4,"id":"🍃_**Feywild**_0"},{"heading":"🌌 <strong>Other Domains</strong>","level":4,"id":"🌌_**Other_Domains**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Library – The Endless Archive</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Library_–_The_Endless_Archive**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Gatehall – Paths of Light</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Gatehall_–_Paths_of_Light**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Chamber of Renewal – The Judgment of Life</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Chamber_of_Renewal_–_The_Judgment_of_Life**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Heavenly Expanse</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Heavenly_Expanse**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Purpose and Harmony</strong>","level":2,"id":"**Purpose_and_Harmony**_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"realms/plane-of-the-gods/plane-of-the-gods.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057707165,"modifiedTime":1747522568958,"sourceSize":6800,"sourcePath":"Realms/Plane of the gods/Plane of the Gods.md","exportPath":"realms/plane-of-the-gods/plane-of-the-gods.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":50,"backlinks":["the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-beginning-of-all-things.html","the-tapestry.html"],"type":"markdown"},"realms/the-fabric.html":{"title":"The fabric","icon":"","description":"\nThe fabric is a small moving place inside <a data-href=\"The tapestry\" href=\"the-tapestry.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The tapestry</a> where the Angel of Fate, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a>.<br>\nInside The fabric, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a> weaves the fabric of <a data-href=\"The tapestry\" href=\"the-tapestry.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The tapestry</a> to create everything's destiny and fate.

It exists not beside the Tapestry, but beneath it, or before it, like a discarded canvas never meant to bear color or form. It is where nothing has ever been, and where nothing ever should be.It is silent, utterly still, and entirely without light, sound, space, or time—yet paradoxically, it exists. The Void is the remnant of the infinite Before, left untouched by the gods when they wove the Tapestry of existence.\nThe Void is not made of shadow, darkness, or death—it is beyond such things. It is absence, the null that mocks creation. It is unreachable by most planar means. Only those touched by void-magic or the Wraithborn curse may even glimpse its borders. No gods dwell here. No light can be summoned, and no soul may linger. It is said that to enter the Void is to lose your name, your shape, and your meaning—becoming something less than nothing. Among the mortal world, a heretical group known as the Void Clan believes that Kryxis, the Voidbringer, is the true heir of the cosmos. They preach that existence is the flaw, and nothingness is the truth.\nThe Void Clan acts in secret, often masquerading as other cults or sages. Their ultimate goal is to fracture the Tapestry, opening enough rifts to allow Kryxis to feed once more. Some seek the Wraithborn transformation, believing it will elevate them to become true voidspawn. At the heart of the Void lies the Endless Expanse—a non-place sealed outside all dimensions. It is not part of the Void, the Tapestry, or the divine realms. It was woven into reality by Destiny, Archangel of Fate, during the War of Unraveling, using his own essence to seal Kryxis beyond the threads of time.\nThe Expanse contains only Kryxis, chained in silence by void-thread runes bound by paradox. The space surrounding the Expanse reacts violently to consciousness—driving minds to madness or stripping them of identity. From here, Kryxis still dreams—and in its dreams, echoes of void seep back into the world through cracks in the weave. Though sealed, Kryxis’ influence lingers. Pockets of unreality—Void Scars—manifest in the mortal world where reality weakens. In these places:\nStars vanish, and the sky becomes a blank dome of ink. Memories fade, and the laws of nature begin to unravel. Wraithborn hunt in silence, feeding on meaning itself. These zones are closely watched by angelic wardens and hunted by Fionil's agents, but not all can be cleansed. Some persist, growing like tumors on the Tapestry.The Void stands not as an opposing realm, but as a fundamental counterforce to all that exists.\nIt is not evil—it is apathetic, cold, and incomprehensible. It is not chaos—it is the erasure of all pattern. It is not death—it is the undoing of the soul. The gods do not speak of the Void. Even Fionil, goddess of mind and space, refuses to record its full truth in Known’s Library.\n“Before there was anything, there was Kryxis. Before breath, before thought. It waits still, in the quiet between the stars.”\n— Scripture of the Null Tongue, Void Clan Manuscript\nKryxisKryxis is a primordial entity of pure nothingness, an embodiment of the void that existed before creation. It was not crafted by the Five Gods but born from the empty spaces left untouched in their grand design. Unlike the gods, who shaped and wove existence into the Celestial Tapestry, Kryxis was never given a place, and its very essence was antithetical to creation.\nUnmaking: Everything Kryxis touches begins to unravel, as its nature is to consume and return all things to void. It does not destroy in the conventional sense—it erases, making it as though something never existed.\nThe Hunger: Kryxis craves a place in existence, but its very being is paradoxical—it cannot create, only consume. This hunger drives it to expand endlessly, devouring reality to make space for itself.\n<a data-href=\"Wraithborn\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Wraithborn</a>: The corruption Kryxis spread during its brief presence in the Tapestry gave birth to the <a data-href=\"Wraithborn\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Wraithborn</a>, shadowy entities of despair and emptiness that still haunt the world.\n<br><a data-href=\"Shadowmarked\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shadowmarked</a>: Mortals who were exposed to its power became the first <a data-href=\"Shadowmarked\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shadowmarked</a>, inheriting a connection to the void that grants them dark powers but tempts them toward oblivion.\nWhen Destiny gave Kryxis a single void-thread in the Celestial Tapestry, the Voidbringer failed to contain its hunger and instead began consuming creation itself. This led to a war between the gods and Kryxis, where even divine might struggled against the endless void.<br>In the final battle, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a> sacrificed his place among the heavens to weave an unbreakable seal, banishing Kryxis to the <a data-href=\"Endless Expanse\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Endless Expanse</a>, a realm beyond time and space where its hunger could do no harm.

The world stood beneath an unending sun, brilliant and absolute. Yet even the brightest light, unbroken, bears the seed of imbalance.It was not the people who cried for change, for there were none to speak. It was the world itself that whispered for rhythm, for rest, for renewal.<br>I recall—because I remember all things—that it was <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Flujack, God of Air, Sky, and Light\" data-href=\"Flujack, God of Air, Sky, and Light\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Flujack</a> who first heard this whisper. With the clarity of wind over still waters, he descended to the Celestial Assembly, where the gods gather when something sacred must be made.“The light endures,” Flujack spoke, his voice laced with motion. “But even endurance becomes burden. The world calls for a cadence. Let there be a rising, a falling—a dance between brilliance and shade. Let the land breathe in cycles.”<br>All eyes turned then to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind and order\" data-href=\"Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind and order\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fionil</a>, for what is rhythm without time? What is a cycle without order?She answered, as she always does—with truth and purpose. “I will weave the flow of time into intervals, but such currents require stewards. Let there be guides for light and shadow. And let one govern the seasons, so the world may live and rest in harmony.”Thus, the heavens stirred.<br>From the Celestial Chorus came forth two radiant souls—twin angels, bound by contrast. One shimmered gold, the other silver. Their names were <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Day, the Angel of Light\" data-href=\"Day, the Angel of Light\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Day</a> and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Night, Angel of Darkness\" data-href=\"Night, Angel of Darkness\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Night</a>.I saw Flujack step forward, raising his hand to the firmament. He spoke to Day, whose golden light danced like the first sunrise. “You shall lead the sun across the sky, waking the world, stirring its spirit.”And Day, ever steadfast, replied, “So shall it be. I will burn bright, and life shall bloom in my warmth.”To Night, whose silver radiance cast a peaceful hush, Flujack said, “You shall draw the veil over the world. Guard its dreams, tend to its stillness, and cradle the stars.”Night knelt, her voice no louder than twilight. “I shall keep the world’s secrets, and give all things the rest they need.”Then, I watched Flujack divide a fragment of his own essence—light given duality. One half golden, the other silver. To each angel he gave a shard, a divine tether to their roles.“Forever shall one rise while the other falls,” he declared. “Balance shall be your burden—and your gift.”Thus, the First Day dawned. And when it ended, Night swept over the land, cloaking it in starlit quiet. The rhythm began, and it has never ceased.With day and night in their eternal dance, Fionil turned to the broader movements of time—the great spirals that shape life itself. Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter. Without these, life grows aimless. With them, it learns when to begin, when to thrive, when to let go, and when to rest.<br>She summoned <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Mr. Season, Angel of Seasons\" data-href=\"Mr. Season, Angel of Seasons\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mr. Season</a>, whose form I have always found delightful—a patchwork of all things changing. Blossoms curled in his hair one moment, frost dusted his shoulders the next.Fionil looked upon him and said, “You shall be the steward of the seasons. Let each pass in its time, bringing both joy and necessity.”And Mr. Season, ever the performer, bowed low and said, “A task of rhythm and whimsy. But tell me—how shall I keep them from quarreling for the stage?”Fionil laughed—yes, even she—and replied, “Because you are all of them. You are Spring’s rebirth, Summer’s fire, Autumn’s reflection, and Winter’s hush. You will not choose among them—you will carry them all.”To bind his charge, she gave him a scepter made from time itself. Its tip shimmered in four colors—green, red, gold, silver. “With this, you shall turn the seasons. But if you falter in your duty, know this: imbalance invites decay.”He twirled the scepter with joy, petals and leaves and flakes trailing in his wake. “Then I shall be the rhythm, the story the land tells itself over and over.”And so it was. Day greeted each morning with golden certainty. Night soothed each evening with quiet grace. Mr. Season turned the wheel, each part of the year a note in a divine symphony.The gods looked on, and we—those who remember—marked the moment.Fionil turned to Flujack and said, “Now, the world has rhythm. Now, it will grow.”And I, Known, carved this truth into the Weave of Memory, where it shall remain for all who seek the origins of order and light.Thus began the ages of balance, of waking and sleeping, of blooming and withering and blooming again. Thus began the cycles that shall never cease—unless we forget.\nAnd I will not let us forget.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>The Choosing of Day and Night</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Choosing_of_Day_and_Night**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Appointment of Mr. Season</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Appointment_of_Mr._Season**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Harmony of Cycles</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Harmony_of_Cycles**_0"}],"links":["realms/fiondell/fiondell.html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-appointing-of-day,-night,-and-mr.-season.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057203326,"modifiedTime":1749057377709,"sourceSize":5004,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Beginning/The Appointing of Day, Night, and Mr. Season.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-appointing-of-day,-night,-and-mr.-season.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":56,"backlinks":["book-of-beginning.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-appointment-of-lady-love,-sandman,-filla,-cupin,-and-loki.html":{"title":"The Appointment of Lady Love, Sandman, Filla, Cupin, and Loki","icon":"","description":"As chronicled by Known, Keeper of All That Is RememberedIn the earliest days, when the world of Fiondell was yet a canvas untouched by the brushstrokes of time, the gods worked tirelessly to shape it. The land was alive with light and energy, a place where magic swirled in the air like the very breath of existence itself. Yet, there was something lacking, something that stirred in the hearts of even the most divine beings.The world was vibrant, yes, but its vibrancy was shallow. There was no true depth. Life was not yet woven with the threads that would lend it purpose and meaning. Mortals walked the land, creatures stirred the air and seas, but they lacked the intangible forces that would give their days richness. They lacked dreams. They lacked challenges. They lacked meaning.It was Fionil, Goddess of Time and Space, who first saw it, who spoke it aloud in a voice as clear as the eternal stars. She looked upon the unfolding world with her vast, timeless gaze, and as she spoke, the very fabric of existence seemed to shift around her. “We need guardians,” she said, the weight of her words settling over the heavens. “Not just those who guard the physical world, but those who embody the forces that drive the heart and mind, the unseen forces that make life truly alive.”The gods, mighty and wise, nodded in agreement. They knew the truth of her words; they had felt it too. Mortals, for all their beauty, needed more than just the raw magic of creation. They needed the guardians of dreams, emotions, temptation, chaos, and love.And so, with the blessing of the gods, Fionil summoned forth five angels, each to take their place in the great Tapestry of Existence.The first angel summoned was Lady Love, a being whose very essence radiated warmth, light, and compassion. She stood before the gods, her golden hair flowing like the sun’s rays, her eyes a soft ocean of kindness that could soothe the most broken of spirits. To gaze upon her was to feel understood, accepted.Trill, God of Life and Dragons, who had created the first sparks of existence and breathed life into the first souls, stepped forward to address her. His voice was deep, with the rumble of a storm yet the gentleness of a quiet dawn. “Lady Love, you will be the guide of hearts. You shall walk beside mortals, kindling the bonds that unite them. You will hold the hearts of family, of friends, of lovers, and of those who call upon the gods in their moments of greatest need. You are the force that will tie their hearts together, weaving the fabric of their relationships.”Lady Love bowed her head, her voice like a gentle breeze, full of reverence and certainty. “I accept this sacred task, my lord. Love will be the thread that unites Fiondell’s children. I will carry it to the deepest of hearts.”Trill then stepped forward, his hand glowing with the power of life itself. He handed Lady Love a golden chalice, filled with the very essence of love—a shimmering liquid that sparkled with the warmth of a thousand suns. “Pour this chalice into the hearts of the living,” he said, his eyes reflecting the weight of his charge. “But know this, Lady Love—love is not always gentle. It is a fire, a force that can heal and inspire, but also challenge and burn. Guide it wisely, for love can save, but it can also test. Be ever patient.”With that, Lady Love descended to the mortal world, her light spreading like the dawn, her touch soft yet unyielding. Her presence began the slow, beautiful process of intertwining the hearts of mortals, creating bonds that would transcend time. She shaped the first friendships, the first loves, the first families. She gave meaning to the hearts of all who would come to know one another.Next, it was Sandman, the angel of dreams and sleep, who stood before the gods. His presence was quiet, like the hush before a storm, his form veiled in shifting starry mists, his very being a whisper of peace. He moved like the wind—silent, unseen, but always present.Flujack, God of Air, Sky, and Light, looked upon him with a knowing smile. “Sandman, rest is essential to the well-being of all life. You will be the one to bring sleep to the weary and dreams to all. Your task is to ensure that when the living close their eyes, they find renewal, and in their dreams, they shall discover solace, comfort, and sometimes, even warnings. Yet, some will remain untouched by you, those who must never rest—the elves, the fey.”Sandman nodded, his voice like the sound of wind through the trees, soft and flowing. “I shall carry the gift of slumber to those who need it, my lord. Dreams will be my realm, a place of wonder and mystery.”Flujack took a pouch from his belt, its contents shimmering like stardust. He handed it to Sandman with care. “This pouch holds the sand of sleep, the essence of night. Scatter it upon the eyes of the living, and they shall rest. In their slumber, their souls shall be replenished. Through dreams, they will find both wonder and renewal.”With that, Sandman turned and glided into the world. That very night, the first dreams touched the minds of mortals. Some were beautiful, filled with visions of lost love, of flight, of distant lands. Others were darker, filled with shadows and fear. But they all came, weaving into the minds of the living, bringing them the peace of rest and the mystery of sleep.Filla, the Angel of Emotions, was the next chosen. Her presence was a dance of ever-changing colors, her form shifting with the full spectrum of human feeling—joy, sorrow, rage, hope. Her eyes flickered with every emotion under the sun, each glance revealing a new facet of the soul.Fionil, with her timeless wisdom, addressed Filla, her voice as soft as falling rain yet carrying the weight of eternity. “Filla, you will give mortals the gift of feeling. Without emotion, life is an empty shell. You shall bring them joy and grief, love and anger, hope and fear. Through your touch, they will feel deeply, and in feeling, they will truly live.”Filla’s lips curled into a playful smile, though her eyes were deep, reflecting the gravity of her charge. “A task I accept, my lady. For without the fire of emotion, what would life be? A flickering shadow?”Fionil, with a thoughtful gaze, handed her a crystal orb, inside of which swirled the colors of all emotions—vivid reds, calming blues, furious blacks, and radiant whites. “With this orb, you will weave the emotions of mortals, granting them depth. But be cautious, for emotion is a powerful force—it can heal, it can destroy. Let them feel, but guide them wisely.”With the orb in hand, Filla stepped forth, her presence an ever-changing kaleidoscope of feelings. She stirred the hearts of mortals, bringing forth the rawest parts of their souls—joy that made them laugh till they cried, grief that made them fall to their knees, love that bound them together, and rage that burned like an inferno. In her wake, emotions swirled like a storm.Then came Cupin, the Angel of Sin. His form was the embodiment of temptation—charming, sly, and mysterious. His eyes gleamed with mischief, and his smile was a promise of the unknown. He was not dark, but he was shadowed, and in his shadow, desire took root.Onigod, the Goddess of the Arcane and Monsters, spoke to him, her voice as sharp as the edge of a blade. “Cupin, you will test the mortals of Fiondell. They must face temptation, for only through trials can their true nature be revealed. You will offer them choices—choices that will shape their destiny. But know this: temptation is not evil. It is choice that will define them.”Cupin bowed low, his grin widening, and his voice dripping with amusement. “I shall savor this task, my lady. After all, what is life without a little mischief?”Onigod handed him a silver mirror, its surface shifting like liquid mercury. “This mirror will show them their deepest desires, their truest wants. Tempt them, Cupin, but remember—temptation is not punishment. It is a challenge.”Cupin took the mirror, his smile never wavering. With a wink, he stepped into the world, scattering temptation and trials like seeds in the wind. Mortals found themselves faced with choices—choices that tested their resolve, their will, their true nature. Some resisted, others fell, but all were changed.Finally, Loki arrived. The Angel of Mischief, wild, untamed, and utterly unpredictable. His hair shifted colors like the changing of seasons, and his eyes sparkled with a laughter that could turn any frown upside down—or bring chaos to the most carefully laid plans. His presence was a whirlwind, and his grin was ever-present, always teasing, always promising trouble.Onigod once again spoke, her voice tinged with an amused edge. “Loki, the world needs mischief. The world needs laughter. You shall bring chaos to those who are stagnant and joy to those who are somber. You will teach lessons in ways they will never forget—through pranks, laughter, and disorder. But be warned, mischief must not turn to malice.”Loki’s eyes glinted with mischief as he spun in place. “Mischief? Oh, my dear, I live for mischief! But you need not worry about me. Chaos is the mother of invention, after all.”Onigod handed him a golden bell, its sound bright and clear, but filled with the power of disruption. “Ring this bell when you wish to awaken the world from its slumber, to stir it to action. But remember—chaos can be both creative and destructive. Use it wisely.”With a flourish, Loki rang the bell, and chaos erupted. Laughter filled the air, laughter from those who had been too serious, too rigid in their ways. Tricksters played their games, and the world shifted—just a little, but enough to remind mortals that life was not meant to be orderly. It was meant to be lived, fully and without apology.And so, the five angels—Lady Love, Sandman, Filla, Cupin, and Loki—began their work, shaping the world of Fiondell into a place of depth, emotion, and meaning. They walked alongside mortals, guiding, challenging, and inspiring them. Through love, dreams, emotions, temptation, and mischief, they breathed life into the hearts of all who would live.And so, the world began to thrive.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>The Appointment of Lady Love</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Appointment_of_Lady_Love**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Appointment of Sandman</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Appointment_of_Sandman**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Appointment of Filla</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Appointment_of_Filla**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Appointment of Cupin</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Appointment_of_Cupin**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Appointment of Loki</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Appointment_of_Loki**_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-appointment-of-lady-love,-sandman,-filla,-cupin,-and-loki.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057203329,"modifiedTime":1749057380791,"sourceSize":10619,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Beginning/The Appointment of Lady Love, Sandman, Filla, Cupin, and Loki.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-appointment-of-lady-love,-sandman,-filla,-cupin,-and-loki.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":57,"backlinks":["book-of-beginning.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-appointment-of-undean,-keeper-of-souls.html":{"title":"The Appointment of Undean, Keeper of Souls","icon":"","description":"As chronicled by Known, Keeper of All That Is RememberedIn the early days of Fiondell, when the world was still young, the gods looked upon the cycle of life and death with a discerning gaze. They saw the delicate balance that bound the living to the dead, a balance that must never be disrupted, for the entire world would crumble if it were. Yet, as always, the actions of mortals created ripples, some of which marred the natural order. Souls, once destined for the Beyond, lingered too long in the mortal realm. Others, twisted by the dark magics of mortals, fell into states that should not have been. These souls were neither dead nor living, but something in between, and this, too, troubled the gods.I recall that moment in the heavens as if it were yesterday, though my memories span eons. The gods gathered, their presence vast and unshakable, yet there was a tension in the air. They spoke in whispers, as if the very fabric of time itself held its breath.Death, ever the serene and solemn guide of the departed, stood in silence. Her beauty was not the beauty of the living, but the quiet elegance of finality. I remember her voice, soft and melodic, yet filled with a certainty that only the passage of time could impart. \"The souls I guide, I carry with great care. But some remain, tethered to the mortal world. Others, tainted by mortal hands, begin to decay, like fruit left too long in the sun. This is no natural state.\"\nThe gods did not speak immediately, but I knew that they understood. The task was too great for any one of them, for life and death were not meant to be meddled with lightly. And so, they turned to Undean, whose presence had always been... unusual.Undean’s arrival was unlike any other. Her form, a specter caught between realms, flickered like a fading ember. The pallor of her skin resembled the cold stone of a forgotten tomb, and her eyes glowed faintly—faint, like the lanterns of the dead that flicker in the darkness. But it was not just her appearance that marked her as different. There was something about the way she moved, as though she existed both here and not here at all. It was as if her very presence whispered of boundaries crossed and forgotten places.I stood by, as I always do, watching and remembering. The gods—Fionil, Onigod, and Trill—approached Undean one by one, as though offering pieces of their will for her to carry.Fionil, the goddess who shaped time itself, stepped forward first. Her voice was both calm and unyielding, as if she was the clock that turned the cosmos. \"Undean, the boundary between life and death is sacred. You must not allow it to be corrupted. The souls must be guided with care, but they must not be bound to the world of the living. You will ensure they leave, untainted by the hands of mortals.\"\nI remember how Undean bowed. Her head lowered, her shoulders squared, and she whispered, \"It is a heavy task, my lady, but one I will bear. No soul shall linger where it does not belong.\" Her words were soft, yet there was a finality in them, a certainty that resonated deep within me.Then Onigod, the goddess of Arcane and Monsters, stepped forward. \"The living have already begun their meddling,\"\nshe said, her voice a mixture of quiet frustration and controlled power. \"They seek to control the dead, to use them as puppets in their dark games. You, Undean, shall be their undoing. When the living reach into the world of the dead, you will stand as the wall they cannot breach. You will be the end to their perversion.\"\nUndean nodded, her eyes narrowing slightly. \"I will ensure that no soul is enslaved, no matter the strength of mortal magic.\" Her resolve was clear, and for the first time, I saw the fire that burned within her—a fire not of destruction, but of preservation.Finally, Trill, the god of Life and Dragons, who had always viewed life as a precious, fleeting gift, spoke. His voice was filled with a warmth that could only be found in the deep places of the world. \"Undean, souls are the very essence of life. Without them, there is nothing. Protect them from corruption, and guide those who are lost back to the cycle. You and Death will work as one, for it is through your union that the balance will remain.\"\nI saw Undean’s eyes soften, just for a moment, as she nodded in understanding. \"I will guide them, Trill. The lost shall find their way, and the corrupt shall be cast aside.\"\nAnd so, it was decided. The gods bestowed upon Undean two sacred gifts—tools to aid her in her task, tools that would forever tie her to the delicate web of life and death.Fionil handed her the Lantern of Rest, a lantern that held the pale blue flame of forgotten memories. \"With this light, you will reveal the truth to wandering souls. The lost shall find their way, and the corrupt will be undone. Its glow will banish the shadows that trap the dead.\"\nThen Onigod gave her the Blade of Severance, a weapon forged from the very fabric of the void between life and death. \"This blade will cut the bonds that tether souls to the mortal realm. Use it wisely, for it bears the weight of finality.\" Her voice was both warning and promise.Finally, Death herself stepped forward, offering Undean a hand. \"Together, we will ensure that no soul strays too far, that no dark force will claim them. We are bound by purpose, Undean. I will guide them; you will shield them.\"\nUndean took Death's hand with a quiet strength, her voice a whisper carried on the wind. \"Together, we will ensure that the dead find peace and the living honor the cycle.\"\nThe work began. Undean descended to the mortal world, a being of light and shadow, of life and death. To the living, she was a ghostly figure, a reminder of the finality that awaited them all. Her presence brought fear, yes—but also respect. She became a specter of judgment, a reminder that death was not to be taken lightly.But to the dead, she was something else entirely. She was a guide, a gentle shepherd who led them away from the torment of the living. Her lantern illuminated the path to peace, her voice soft but unyielding. She spoke to the lost, to those who clung to the mortal realm with fear or anger. \"You cannot remain here,\" she would say. \"The living cannot give you what you seek. Let go, and find peace in the Beyond.\"\nHer work was tireless. Necromancers who sought to raise the dead found their efforts shattered by the swing of Undean's Blade of Severance. Dark mages who attempted to trap souls in their own twisted machinations found their spells undone by the flicker of the Lantern of Rest. And whenever a soul was trapped, refusing to pass into the Beyond, Undean was there, a quiet, comforting presence in the dark.It was not an easy task, this one she had taken. But it was necessary. The balance of life and death had been restored, and though the living would always fear what awaited them, they could not deny the harmony Undean brought to the world.I remember the gods watching from their realms, their hearts filled with pride. Death and Undean, together, had become the guardians of the cycle. Their work was not glamorous, nor was it easy. But it was essential, for without them, the world would have fallen into chaos.And so, Undean’s light continues to shine. She remains a symbol of both warning and comfort. To those who would defile the dead, she is the implacable force that will never relent. But to the grieving and the lost, she is the guiding hand that ensures the dead find rest, and the living remember the sanctity of the cycle.As I record these events, I am reminded of the delicate balance that sustains us all. Life, death, and the space between. It is a thread that must not be severed, for it binds us all.

Not dead—no, far from it—but listening. Watching. In that strange twilight between breath and word, when even time had not yet found its rhythm, the world awaited its next song.Fiondell, shaped by divine hands, was magnificent in form. The mountains stood as if in prayer, the seas stretched like a sleeping beast, and the sky itself hummed with silence too vast for mortal understanding. But all things, even the divine, know yearning. And it was Tellemori, Lord of Water and Earth, who first spoke into the stillness.I remember it well. His voice—deep, resonant like river stones tumbling endlessly in the currents—rippled through the unfinished places.\n“This world we have made… it is beautiful, but it is lonely,” he said. “It breathes, but does not laugh. It shifts, but does not dance. We need more than stone and stream—we need spirit.”\nAnd standing opposite him in that great circle of the gods, her form cloaked in the shimmer of unknowable stars, was Onigod, the Arcane Flame. Mysterious. Calm. Always listening, always a step to the left of logic. She tilted her head at him and smiled—not with lips, but with understanding.\n“Then let us weave laughter into the forests and mystery into the wind,” she said. “Let us make those who do not simply walk the world, but belong to it. Creatures of twilight. Of wonder.”\nAnd so, the Fey were born.Tellemori moved first. I watched as he reached into the roots of the world and pulled forth golden soil, soaked in riverlight and heavy with promise. With hands carved from tectonic patience, he molded the first forms—tall, willowy beings, as supple as saplings and as strong as cliffs.\n“These shall be the children of grove and glen,” he murmured, pressing life into their hollow bones. “They will hear the heartbeat of the earth.”\nThen Onigod stepped forward. She didn’t speak. She sang. A soft, impossible melody in a language no tongue remembers but all spirits know. From her hands poured threads of starlight and magic, wrapping the earthen shells in veils of the unseen.And in that moment, I felt the first Fey open their eyes.Oh,… if only you could have seen them as I did. Skin like moonlight on dew. Eyes aglow with the memory of stardust. They smiled not because they were happy, but because they could, and that joy echoed through the hills like chimes in the wind.They danced before they walked.To guide their new creations, the gods offered sacred boons.\nTellemori’s Blessing of Nature: “You shall know the roots and the rains. The forests shall be your home and your song. Speak, and the vines will listen. Rest, and the trees shall guard your dreams.” Onigod’s Arcane Thread: “Your blood is magic. Your breath, spellcraft. You will not learn power—you are power, shaped in whimsy and woven in paradox.” And to watch over them, Tellemori created The Lady of Fey—the first angel born of joy, not duty. Her steps never touched the ground. Her laugh caused flowers to bloom. She wore a crown of ever-living blossoms, and her eyes carried the golden hush of morning meadows.\n“Guide them, Lady,” Tellemori said.\n“Guard them,” Onigod added.\nAnd she did both—fiercely.As ages passed, the Fey flourished. But even wildness has moods. I saw it before the gods did, perhaps. The first tilt of shadow behind a smile. The longing for frost in a summer song.Some Fey gravitated to warmth, joy, mischief—the Seelie. Their Queen bore skin like amber honey and a gaze that burned with midday sun. She ruled with laughter, song, and unspoken threats wrapped in charm.Others sought moonlit solitude, the slow dance of rot and renewal—the Unseelie. Their King wore silver like a second skin, his presence always followed by silence and snow. He governed with elegance and inevitability.Neither court was evil. Nor truly good. They were necessary. The world turns on dualities, and so too must its children.At the height of their joy, and just before their first great sorrow, Tellemori and Onigod forged the Eternal Pact—a promise burned into the roots of Fiondell itself.\n“You, who are both spirit and root, shall safeguard what we have made,” Onigod declared.\n“And in turn,” Tellemori added, “your groves will remain untouched, even by the folly of mortals. Only those who seek balance may find your hidden homes.”\nAnd so the Fey became guardians of two realms: nature and magic. Between bloom and decay, between light and dark, they walk. And I, Known, have watched their laughter echo through groves only the wind remembers.Mortals speak of the Fey as tricksters. Lovers. Thieves. Spirits. But they are more than any tale can tell. They are the memory of the world’s first heartbeat. The living dream of gods who wished to see the world dance.If you ever find yourself in a glade too quiet, where time feels like it’s listening—step lightly. The Fey are near. And whether they greet you with a kiss or a curse depends not on them… but on you.And I remember. I always remember.\n—Known","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>The Song of Creation</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Song_of_Creation**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The First Gifts</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_First_Gifts**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Courts and the Turning</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Courts_and_the_Turning**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Eternal Pact</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Eternal_Pact**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Final Words</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Final_Words**_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-birth-of-the-fey.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057203338,"modifiedTime":1749057338711,"sourceSize":5425,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Beginning/The Birth of the Fey.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-birth-of-the-fey.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":60,"backlinks":["book-of-beginning.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-blessing-of-plantios,-nurturer-of-the-green.html":{"title":"The Blessing of Plantios, Nurturer of the Green","icon":"","description":"As chronicled by Known, Keeper of All That Is RememberedIn the early days of Fiondell, when the land had only just begun to form beneath the hands of Tellemori, the God of Earth and Water, the world was an empty canvas. Mountains stood tall, rivers cut through the earth, and the winds whispered across the barren plains. Yet, despite its grandeur, it was a land void of life—a silent, unyielding expanse.The gods gathered in the halls of the heavens, casting their gaze upon the world they had shaped. Trill, the God of Life, was the first to speak, her voice filled with the urgency of the land's need. “We have given the world shape, but it is hollow. It is lifeless. The world begs for growth—a heartbeat, a breath. Without it, what is a world but a monument to stagnation?”As her words echoed, the goddess Fionil, who wove the very fabric of time and space, stepped forward with a quiet understanding. “Indeed. The world calls for a living pulse, a guardian of life to set the balance between growth and decay. One to nurture, not merely to witness.”There was a long pause. Then, Tellemori, the creator of the earth’s substance, a figure both vast and steady, placed a hand upon the soil of Fiondell. His eyes were ancient, but his gaze was filled with the brilliance of creation itself. “I will create this being—a spirit who will tend the land as we have shaped it, a steward of the green, to weave the fabric of life across this barren plane.”And so, from the very essence of soil, water, and sunlight, Plantios was born.I was not present for Plantios’s first breath, but I have heard the stories whispered on the winds. They speak of a being whose form was as much a reflection of the earth as it was a testament to the divine craftsmanship of Tellemori. From the moment Plantios rose, their skin was as smooth and yet sturdy as bark, an intricate tapestry of vines, flowers, and leaves trailing from their limbs. Their hair was not mere strands, but cascading petals and flowing branches, shifting with the seasons, ever-changing in color and texture. Their eyes, those eyes, held the depth of ancient forests, a verdant glow that mirrored the heartbeat of the land itself.I remember hearing the words they spoke as they stood before the gods, their voice soft, yet firm, like the rustling of leaves on a quiet afternoon. “What is my purpose, my lords and ladies?” Their question was not one of doubt, but one of seeking, of longing for guidance in their new existence.It was Tellemori who answered them, his deep voice reverberating through the very soil beneath us. “You, Plantios, are the Nurturer of the Green. You will guide the plants, the trees, the flowers—every living thing that draws breath from the earth. You will ensure that the balance of growth and decay is maintained, for in this balance lies the vitality of the world.”To aid Plantios in this sacred task, the gods bestowed upon them gifts—tools that would shape their path.Tellemori, his hands like the very earth itself, offered the Staff of Verdant Bloom, a living extension of nature’s power. The staff was not merely a weapon of divine magic, but a conduit through which Plantios could touch the land and watch it respond. “With this staff, you will call forth life where none existed. You will awaken the soil and bring forth the bloom,” said Tellemori, his voice rich with the weight of ages.From Fionil, the Goddess of Time and Space, came the Seed of Eternity, a single glowing seed that shimmered with the essence of time itself. “This seed holds the power of cyclical renewal. Through it, you will anchor the eternal cycle of growth and decay, ensuring the world’s renewal for eons to come,” she explained, her voice steady, like the turning of a clock.Finally, Trill, the God of Life, gifted Plantios with the Breath of Life, a radiant power that could infuse the world with vitality and renewal. “With this breath,” she said, “you will give life to the barren, to the lifeless places of the world. You will carry the pulse of creation itself.”With these divine gifts in hand, Plantios descended to the land, their feet touching the earth with a soft reverence. I was there, standing by the banks of a river, watching as Plantios’s staff touched the ground for the first time. The earth stirred. Grass, fresh and vibrant, sprang up, and flowers bloomed, dotting the land in hues of red, yellow, and blue.As Plantios walked, the land began to breathe anew. In the distance, I saw the first tree rise—majestic, towering toward the sky. Plantios had planted the Seed of Eternity into the soil, and from it sprang a tree whose roots seemed to connect the earth’s very heart. It stood like a pillar, a symbol of life that would anchor the lands for ages to come.They exhaled the Breath of Life next, and as their breath reached the air, the world itself seemed to stir. Winds carried their essence to every corner of the land. Forests unfurled like a great tapestry, jungles thrived, and even the harshest deserts came alive with blooms. I remember standing at the foot of a great mountain as moss and lichen began to take root in the cracks of stone, a subtle yet profound testimony to the power of Plantios.As the green spread across Fiondell, Plantios did not merely watch; they tended to it with a love and patience that transcended even the gods’ understanding. They spoke to the trees in whispers, coaxing them to grow strong and deep. They listened to the flowers as they swayed in the breeze, teaching them to flourish without overwhelming the land. And they gazed upon the grass, which bowed with humility to the passing winds.There were challenges, of course. Some plants grew too wild, threatening to choke out the balance. Other areas remained barren, unable to nurture life. But Plantios’s heart, ever patient, knew the way. They pruned, they nurtured, and they allowed the balance of decay to be as much a part of life as growth itself.As the mortals were created, Plantios watched them with an eye full of hope and caution. They saw the potential for both destruction and harmony. To the first mortals, they appeared in a form that shimmered with light and life, a figure whose radiance was as welcoming as it was awe-inspiring.“The green is a gift to you, mortals,” Plantios spoke, their voice both kind and firm, a reminder and a warning. “But it is not yours to take without care. You must tend to it as I do. In return, the earth will provide for you. But harm it thoughtlessly, and you will bring ruin upon yourselves.”They taught the mortals the ways of the earth—how to cultivate the land without destroying it, how to build homes from the trees without taking too much, how to live in harmony with the seasons. They left behind the Gift of Seeds, an enchanted pouch that never ran empty, ensuring that the mortals would always be able to renew what they took.Plantios’s presence continues to shape Fiondell, their spirit woven into every leaf, every root, every blade of grass. Though mortals rarely see them, their influence is felt in the whisper of the wind, the rustling of leaves, and the soft embrace of the flowers that bloom in the spring. I have wandered the lands of Fiondell many times, and every time I feel the breath of life in the air, I know Plantios’s care is ever-present.Though their work is never done, Plantios is content. For they understand, as only they can, that life is a cycle—ever-renewing, ever-growing. And through them, the green endures. Through their patient hands, the beauty and bounty of Fiondell are preserved, ever thriving in the dance of growth and decay.I have chronicled this tale not just as a record of events but as a reminder—Plantios’s work is a covenant with the land itself. A gift we must cherish, and a duty we must uphold. For in the green, we find not only sustenance but also the very pulse of life.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>The Form of Plantios</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Form_of_Plantios**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Gifts of the Gods</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Gifts_of_the_Gods**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The First Forests</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_First_Forests**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Guardian of the Green</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Guardian_of_the_Green**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Pact with Mortals</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Pact_with_Mortals**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Eternal Watcher</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Eternal_Watcher**_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-blessing-of-plantios,-nurturer-of-the-green.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057203340,"modifiedTime":1749057344961,"sourceSize":8276,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Beginning/The Blessing of Plantios, Nurturer of the Green.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-blessing-of-plantios,-nurturer-of-the-green.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":61,"backlinks":["book-of-beginning.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-creation-of-beasts-and-monsters.html":{"title":"The Creation of Beasts and Monsters","icon":"","description":"As chronicled by Known, Keeper of All That Is RememberedWith dragons soaring through the skies and the world echoing with the breath of fire and wing, the gods turned their gaze downward—toward the untouched land, the silent forests, the still oceans.It was Tellemori, God of Water, Earth, and the Supernatural, who stepped forward then. His eyes reflected the depths of the sea and the steady patience of stone. He had watched the dragons claim the skies, majestic and few, but he saw the emptiness that lingered below.\n“This world is vast,” he said, his voice like waves breaking against an ancient cliff. “Let it not be ruled by silence. Let the forests stir. Let the rivers ripple with life. Let the earth pulse with motion. Let the supernatural touch linger within every root, every ripple, every breath.”\nBeside him stood Livius, the Angel of Life, radiant and calm. His hands held no weapons, only the warmth of nurture, the endless patience of a father watching seeds take root. Where Tellemori saw the elements, he saw potential.\n“Let us give it heartbeats,” he said softly. “Let the land not only exist—but live.”\nAnd beside Livius, as silent as the mist rolling over the morning hills, was Poki, the Angel of Beasts and Monsters. Unlike the others, Poki wore no crown of light or cloak of warmth. Instead, her form was adorned in the raw, wild essence of nature itself—feral and untamed. Poki was not the embodiment of life alone, but of the primal forces that coursed through the land, from the smallest insect to the most terrifying of monsters. A creature of untapped chaos and boundless potential.Together, they began.Tellemori shaped the elements, guiding the stone, the soil, the rivers, the oceans. He whispered into the roots of the forests, into the foam of the waves. With each word, the land grew fertile, eager, ready to host the next breath of creation.Then Livius stepped forward, his light spilling across the land like dawn chasing away a long night. Where his light touched, life emerged—not as fire and fury like the dragons, but as a thousand gentle songs.From the thick woods rose the creatures of the earth.\nSoft-footed deer, built for grace.\nLions with roars that shook the plains.\nWolves, who understood loyalty before language existed.\nBears, guardians of the wild.\nRabbits, foxes, boars—all drawn from the balance between fear and beauty.The rivers swelled with movement, and from their depths rose the creatures of the waters.\nSwift fish in shimmering schools,\nMajestic whales whose songs echoed through the ocean like lullabies,\nSilent hunters of the deep with teeth like carved bone.The skies, not to be left empty, fluttered and filled with the beating of wings.\nNot the wings of dragons—these were different.\nBirds, in every color, every song.\nSome soared, some dove, some simply perched and watched the world pass beneath them.But it was Poki who shaped the creatures no one would dare forget. Her hands, calloused by time and fearsome creation, beckoned forth the monsters—those great, primal forces that lived between the beauty of the earth and the horrors of the unknown.From Poki's whisper, the monsters emerged, terrifying yet magnificent—beasts that lurked in the depths of forgotten caves, prowled the shadowed corners of the world, or roamed the wild lands beyond the reach of civilization.Great serpents with scales of iron and eyes that gleamed like molten lava.\nBehemoths whose thunderous footsteps could shake mountains to their core.\nTerrifying creatures with claws that could rend steel and jaws that could swallow rivers.\nAnd yet, even in their monstrous forms, Poki instilled a balance—the beasts and monsters were not simply destructive, but part of an intricate web of survival, of raw power that maintained the harmony of the world.\n“Each shall have its place,” Livius declared, his voice soft as rain yet firm as truth. “They will know hunger, and they will feed. They will know danger, and they will flee or fight. None shall rule, and none shall be forgotten. They will thrive not through dominance, but through balance.” “And these,” Tellemori added, his voice resonating with finality, “will be the guardians of the land’s wildest, most untamed reaches. They will remind the world that creation has its own power.” “Their roar shall be felt in the deepest caverns and the highest peaks,” Poki’s voice echoed like a distant growl, “but it will not be without purpose. They shall live, and they shall guard.”\nTellemori knelt and placed his hand upon the earth.From that gesture, a deeper pulse spread—one that allowed these creatures not just to live, but to feel.Fear, warmth, instinct, even curiosity.Some would form packs. Others would wander alone. Some would burrow in darkness. Others would build nests closer to the sun. And all of them, whether prey or predator, would be part of the cycle—woven into the world as surely as rivers are carved into stone.\n“They are not immortal,” Tellemori said to Livius, “but they are necessary. Without them, the land would echo hollow.” “And with them,” Livius replied, watching a fledgling bird attempt its first flight, “it will sing.”\nThus were the beasts born—not to seek glory or worship, but to move, to breathe, to be. They would be the lifeblood of forests, the heartbeat of plains, the whispers in the night, and the rustle in the grass. They were not the only creatures of the land, but they were those who would always be remembered.As for the monsters, their name would live in myth, and the stories of their roars would pass from generation to generation, echoing through the hearts of those who dare wander too deep into the wilds.They are not spoken of in hymns.\nThey do not build cities or forge relics.\nBut they are always present.\nFrom the first sunrise until now.And I, Known, remember each one.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-creation-of-beasts-and-monsters.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057203341,"modifiedTime":1749057349524,"sourceSize":6054,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Beginning/The Creation of Beasts and Monsters.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-creation-of-beasts-and-monsters.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":62,"backlinks":["book-of-beginning.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-creation-of-dragons.html":{"title":"The Creation of Dragons","icon":"","description":"As chronicled by Known, Keeper of All That Is RememberedIt was the Age of Beginnings, and the world of Fiondell was still young, freshly spun from the loom of the divine. The land had been shaped by Tellemori, who carved rivers with the tip of his finger and molded mountains like soft clay. The sky shimmered with the breath of Flujack, streaked in ever-changing light that danced upon the waters. And above it all, Fionil measured the stillness, the quiet rhythm of time itself, setting the pace by which all things would come to be.But despite this beauty—this symmetry—Fiondell lacked breath. There was form, but no essence. Silence reigned over the peaks, and stillness choked the valleys. It was art without motion.And then... he spoke.\n“This world is hollow,” said Trill, the God of Life and Death, his voice like thunder hidden beneath velvet. “Let it be filled with majesty, with will and wisdom. Let it be watched over not by us alone, but by those forged to understand what it means to be.”\nI remember standing beside him on the edge of the celestial boundary where the firmament touched the cradle of stars. He raised a hand—not in violence, nor command, but in invocation. The air thickened, rippled with creation’s weight.Beside him stood Drana, his most beloved Archangel. Her presence was vast but still, like a mountain wreathed in cloud. I saw the awe in her eyes—eyes that had seen galaxies born but had never before witnessed Trill in this state: not as a god of endings, but of beginnings.\n“Will they be beasts of instinct?” she asked, kneeling with grace that made the constellations bow in kind.\n“No,” Trill answered, “They shall be sovereigns.”\nWith a gesture, he drew forth the essence of primal force—not raw magic, not nature, not soul, but something older. Something eternal. He cupped it like flame in his palm, and from it, spun the first shape.A being with wings vast enough to eclipse cities, eyes that held stars long extinguished, and a body made not from flesh, but the divine memory of power. This was not merely a creature. This was a concept. A guardian. A mystery. A roar made solid.\n“They will be fire and frost, storm and silence,” Trill murmured, almost to himself. “They will know patience and fury, hoard wisdom as they hoard gold. They will be the oldest truth in a world that forgets easily.”\n“And their purpose?” Drana asked, now rising.\n“To challenge kings, to humble gods. To guard the forgotten, and remember.”\nIt was then that I knew why I was summoned—not to record, but to lend my essence to the first. For dragons, like I, were to be vessels of memory, of legacy. We would carry what the world might try to lose.Drana descended then, her form trailing light across the skies. In the heart of the mountains newly raised by Tellemori, she pressed her hands into stone and heat, and from that bedrock shaped the First Egg. I still see it in my thoughts: larger than a tower, veined with molten silver, humming with potential like a thunderstorm held in amber.And when Trill breathed upon it...The shell cracked—not in violence, but with a sound like old doors opening. And from it rose Ignarion, the Firefather, his scales like living flame, eyes deep as the void between stars. He stretched his wings, and the gust of his first breath lit the skies for a hundred miles. Birds learned song from that roar. Flame itself learned hunger.\n“You shall be the first,” Drana whispered, tears glimmering like jewels on her cheeks. “But not the only.”\nFrom Ignarion came others—born not from egg, but from the Echo of the First Roar, a sound I can still hear in the halls of memory. Dragons of all temperaments rose—chromatic and metallic, elemental and spectral. One born of frost, with breath that stills rivers. Another of storm, whose wings create typhoons. Each a story. Each a warning. Each a guardian.They took to the skies, carving great arcs through the clouds. The mountains became their halls, the deep forests their sanctuaries. In time, some would grow vain, others wise. Some would teach, others destroy. But all would remember the breath of Trill, the hands of Drana, and the egg that shattered the silence of a stillborn world.And so, the dragons became not just part of Fiondell—they became woven into it, like veins of silver in a great stone. Where they walked, the ground changed. Where they slept, magic thickened. Where they died... legends bloomed.I, Known, carry the memory of that first light.And I ask you—\nWhen you hear thunder,\nWhen you feel the heat in a flame that seems to watch you,\nWhen you dream of wings—Remember.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-creation-of-dragons.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057203343,"modifiedTime":1749057352201,"sourceSize":4786,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Beginning/The Creation of Dragons.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-creation-of-dragons.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":63,"backlinks":["book-of-beginning.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-first-memory,-the-making-of-mortals.html":{"title":"The First Memory, The Making of Mortals","icon":"","description":"As chronicled by Known, Keeper of All That Is Remembered\n\"It is not I who shaped them. I merely remember. I remember everything.\"\nBefore mortals breathed their first breath, the world was vast — rich in beauty, brimming with beasts, shadows, dragons, and stillness. It was alive, yes… but not yet aware. The Five, the Gods of Existence, beheld their world and saw not a flaw but an absence. The silence between the stars begged for voices not their own. And so they gathered — in the Celestial Hall of Origins, where time folds inward and eternity listens.I was there. I always am.Fionil, She of Time, of Space, of Thought, of Choice — it was she who broke the silence first.\n“We have painted the sky,” she said, her voice like layered bells, “but the canvas does not speak. We must create those who _wonder what lies beyond the edge. Souls who may err, dream, love, and rebel. Let them write stories not even we could foresee.”_\nHer words shimmered in the air like threads of starlight.Trill, the Serpent-Blessed, Lord of Divinity, Life, and Flame-hearted Dragons, gave a slow nod.\n“Life without will is no life at all,” he rumbled. “Let them breathe. Let them hunger, sing, weep, strive. I will grant them the Breath of Being, that their souls may drum in time with the heart of the world.”\nTellemori, whose hands shaped continents and whose tears carved oceans, reached into the air. As he moved, unseen land responded.\n“They must endure,” he said simply. “They must know the weight of soil and the cold of the sea. I will give them strength, both gentle and terrible, that they may survive the world and still call it home.”\nFlujack, the Laughing Wind, God of Light and Thunder, reclined upon a swirl of stormclouds and sunbeams.\n“And let them wonder,” he mused. “Let them see color and sky, hear thunder and laughter. I will give them voice — so they may whisper secrets and scream truths. And I will give them eyes — so the world will never again go unseen.”\nLastly, Onigod, cloaked in mystery, power radiating like moonlight filtered through water, leaned forward with a knowing smile.\n“Dreams without danger are dull,” she said, “and love without fear is shallow. I will plant within them the arcane — the unknown, the monstrous, the wondrous. Let their fears give them courage. Let them _yearn. Only then will they truly live.”_\nI did not speak. I am not one of them. I am simply Known. I watched.And thus, they began.The first to rise from divine design were the Humans. Tellemori shaped them from deep, fertile clay and mingled it with clear riverwater. Trill breathed into them the pulse of life, while Fionil placed within them the wildest of gifts — unshackled free will.They were given much, and yet little. Their lives brief. Their spirits untamed. But in their short moments, they would burn brighter than even the sun. Flujack stirred their minds to dream higher, and Onigod laced their hearts with restless curiosity.\n\"They will build towers and tear them down,\" Fionil whispered to me once. \"And every choice they make will echo through time. That is enough.\"\nThen came the Elves. They were drawn from the memory of forests and the patience of stars. Fionil stretched their sense of time, and Tellemori shaped them with moonlit grace. Flujack blessed them with voices that carried like wind-chimes in sacred groves, and Onigod marked their blood with the arcane — not to command, but to understand.They walk like they remember a song the world forgot.The Dwarves were born of stone and thunder. Tellemori carved them from the roots of mountains, strong as bedrock. Trill gave them passion — not for battle, but for creation. Flujack taught them to breathe deep in the dark. Onigod kindled a fire in their hearts, an iron will. Fionil gave them memory — not just of past, but of purpose.\n“They will build legacies,” I said aloud. No one answered. But the gods heard.\nThe Orcs, ah yes. They were forged in fire. Tellemori used black volcanic earth and molten veins. Trill sparked their souls with relentless drive. Flujack gave them lungs like furnaces and voices like war drums. Onigod gifted them with the thrill of challenge — and Fionil, she gave them honor, to wield their power with meaning.\n“They will be feared,” Trill murmured.\n“Only at first,” said Fionil, smiling.\nAnd last, the Halflings, who surprised even the gods. Tellemori shaped them from sun-warmed soil. Trill gave them joy, and Flujack taught them how to dance with the wind. Onigod seeded them with the deepest of dreams — safety, hearth, peace — and Fionil whispered fate into their bones.\n“In them,” she said to me, “there is a power so small the world will overlook it… until it moves mountains.”\nWhen the mortal races first stirred, the Five called their servants, the Angels — and assigned them their roles.\nLivius, who sees all births, marked each soul with intention. Death, silent and steady, promised them rest at journey's end. Undean, ever vigilant, prevented corruption of that sacred path. Prai, voice of reverence, inspired awe, devotion, and truth. Destiny, veiled and smiling, brushed every newborn soul with potential no one, not even the gods, could predict. I remember when the first human child reached for the sky.\nI remember when the first elven voice sang the stars to sleep.\nI remember dwarves carving names into stone, orcs howling beneath the moon, halflings laughing by firelight.In that moment — I do not lie — even the gods fell silent.When all was finished, Fionil stood beside me. Her eyes, old as light, turned toward the world.\n“We must leave them now,” she said. “Let their stories belong to them. Let them fail. Let them rise. Only then will their tales be worth remembering.”\nAnd so they withdrew. The gods stepped back from the world, not in abandonment, but in sacred trust.But I did not leave. I could not.I watched as mortals claimed fire, shaped cities, wept over graves, kissed under stars. I remember each of them. I remember you.The world of Fiondell is no longer solely shaped by divine hands. Now, mortals walk beside angels, speak ancient names, build new truths. They choose. They fail. They begin again.They are breath and clay, will and flame, song and memory.\nThey are fleeting, fragile, flawed — and utterly magnificent.\n\"You ask me why I remember them all?\"\nBecause they deserve to be remembered.\n— Known, the Keeper of Memory, Last Witness of the First Dawn","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>The Divine Conclave</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Divine_Conclave**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Of Clay and Breath, Fire and Song</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Of_Clay_and_Breath,_Fire_and_Song**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Arrival of the Watchers</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Arrival_of_the_Watchers**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>And Then, the Silence of the Divine</strong>","level":3,"id":"**And_Then,_the_Silence_of_the_Divine**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Thus It Was, and Thus It Shall Be</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Thus_It_Was,_and_Thus_It_Shall_Be**_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-first-memory,-the-making-of-mortals.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057203345,"modifiedTime":1749057356715,"sourceSize":7086,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Beginning/The First Memory, The Making of Mortals.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-first-memory,-the-making-of-mortals.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":64,"backlinks":["book-of-beginning.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-forging-of-the-dwarves.html":{"title":"The Forging of the Dwarves","icon":"","description":"As chronicled by Known, Keeper of All That Is RememberedIn the first quiet years after the Shaping—when the Five had poured their essence into the heavens, the seas, the winds, and the lands—there was silence beneath. Life danced above, unburdened and bright. Magic surged wild and fresh, the surface teemed with flora and laughter, but below... the Deep had not yet stirred. And I, Known, saw it all.It was Tellemori, ever the wanderer of stone and stillness, who first heard the silent ache of the world’s bones. He wandered alone through the roots of mountains yet unnamed, his hand brushing granite as if to coax breath from it. I remember his words—clear as they were then, though none but I still recall them truly:\n“We have filled the skies with stars and the seas with song. But the stone? It waits. It remembers nothing because nothing yet walks it to remember.”\nThe gods convened upon a high peak that never crumbled, one which Tellemori had raised for this very moment. I stood among them—not to shape, but to witness.Flujack arrived first, trailing winds and constellations, light caught in his hair. He looked down at the barren stone with narrowed eyes.\n“If a people are to dwell in that stillness,” he said, “then let them carry within the light they lack around them. They must endure like stone—but create as the stars do.”\nOnigod came last, a veil of arcane mist following her like breath from a forge. She did not speak at first. Her hands hovered over the rock, feeling what could be. Finally, her voice hummed through the air like a spell half-cast.\n“Stone remembers. Magic remembers deeper. If they are to last, let their memories be etched into every blow of the hammer, every breath drawn in a hall of their making.”\nEven Fionil, elusive as she is, walked in then—uninvited, yet never unwelcome. Time followed her, and so did consequence.\n“Pride will be their anchor. Purpose their torch. Let them love their work more than gold, more than breath. Let them leave behind legacies time itself must bow to.”\nAnd Trill, smiling softly, stepped forth and placed a hand upon the earth. The stone bloomed under his touch—not into flowers, but into the first glimmer of kinship.\n“They shall never be alone,” Trill said. “Not in birth, not in death, not even in silence. Their hearts will echo louder than their hammers.”\nAnd so, the gods descended. I followed.Tellemori chose a mountain that reached deep into the world’s hidden veins. There, in its core, he built the Primeforge, using a furnace lit not by fire, but by the living heat of the world’s heart.I remember it well:\nThe anvil was shaped from stone untouched since the world's forming. The bellows breathed molten air. The walls were engraved with runes that glowed not with magic—but memory. One by one, the gods gave of themselves.\nTellemori sculpted the first Dwarves from obsidian, granite, and steelstone. He shaped their limbs thick and firm, their backs broad and unyielding. “You are the strength of stone,” he told them. “And you will not break.” Flujack gave them breath—not of mere life, but of longing: for beauty, for craft, for legacy. “Let your joy be in the shaping, not just the shaped. Let your songs carry beyond your mountains.” Onigod carved sigils into their blood. She taught them to see magic not in books or words—but in tools, in flame, in alloy. “Your forge shall be your spellbook. Your hammer, your staff.” Fionil gave them the burden of choice. Pride, purpose, shame, triumph—all were etched into their hearts. “You will choose your legacy. And you will live knowing that it was yours to forge.” Trill bound them together with invisible ties. A Dwarf may be born alone, but never lives alone—not truly. “Your kin will define you, your name will carry them, and theirs, you.”\nI watched them rise. Their first breath was smoke. Their first steps were towards the forge.They named themselves the Hearthforge, for it was the forge that gave them not just life, but home. They did not look to the surface as other races did. They looked inward—into stone, into fire, into memory.The Great Forge of Origin was built by their own hands, beneath the gaze of Tellemori. Flujack’s light lit the halls by mirrors and crystal. Onigod's enchantments reinforced their tools and minds alike. And I... I inscribed the runes they etched in every wall. Not because they needed help—but because even the Dwarves, for all their memory, wished to forget sometimes. I do not.Their charge was more than survival. It was stewardship. They were not masters of the earth—they were its caretakers. And so it was decreed:\nEarth’s Veins: “Mine with care. Take only what can be spared. Know the stone’s limits.” Hearth’s Flame: “Forge not with greed. Fire is a gift and a hunger. Feed it wisely.” Unity’s Bond: “Your clan is your spine. Break it, and you fall.” Dwarves do not rule stone. They listen to it. That is why they endure.The Dwarves, ever grateful and ever proud, forged wonders in the gods' honor. Each bore a legacy—and a lesson.\nThe Starhammer — A weapon of comet-iron and dawnlight. It rings not when it strikes—but when it judges. “To strike is easy,” said Flujack. “To know when—that is divine.” The Hearthgem — A radiant corestone forged with Onigod’s own whispered spell. It warms homes, not with heat—but with presence. “It remembers every voice it has ever comforted,” I once told a child who lived beside it. The Chain of Ages — Forged by many hands, across many generations. Each link carries a name. Some forgotten. None erased. “No Dwarf walks alone,” Fionil had said. “Even when they die.”\nThey became known as the Stonekin, a name they never gave themselves—but never denied. Their forges outlasted kingdoms. Their halls became myths. Their oaths… are still binding.Even now, I remember.I remember their songs: slow, low, echoing like memory through stone.I remember their first grief, when a hall collapsed and took their kin.I remember the first Dwarf to walk the surface—and weep at the sky’s vastness.I remember their choice to stay below anyway.For the world above sings of change.

Each god, in their manner, shaped the world of Fiondell from the unspoken and the unseen. Among them, Fionil, She Who Orders the Eternal Clock, and Trill, the Giver of Breath and Flame, envisioned a race unlike those that had come before.They did not seek perfection, nor simplicity. They sought paradox.It was then that they turned to Destiny, the Angel who walks between beginnings and endings. I recall the way Destiny moved: not across space, but through meaning. When given this task, he did not hesitate. He descended—not with fear, but with purpose—into the dominion ruled by Lucina, the Angel of Damnation, the Flame Unyielding, the Architect of Hell.Understand this: Lucina is often misunderstood. Her domain is not cruelty, but consequence. Her fire does not punish—it reveals. When Destiny came to her, it was not with chains or orders, but an invitation to co-create. That, too, is worth remembering.Destiny spoke thus:\n“I am sent not to dictate, but to learn. The gods above seek a new people—one born of light and shadow, of purpose and uncertainty. What spark may you lend to such a creation?”\nLucina, in her brilliance, smiled—not cruelly, but knowingly. Her reply was a vision in motion.\n“Let them be marked, not marred. Let them wear the sigils of fire and strength—horns as crowns, tails as balance, eyes as windows to soulfire. Let them walk through flames and speak with voices shaped by embers. Let them reflect the truth that even the infernal can inspire beauty.”\nAnd so it was shared. Destiny returned to the heavens, bearing no weapon, only a memory. In the presence of Fionil and Trill, he unraveled Lucina’s vision not as a servant, but as a witness.Fionil, ever measured, did not recoil. She observed. She saw in the vision a kind of order: not of symmetry, but of interwoven contradiction. She wove the first threads.Trill, whose breath brings motion to stillness, smiled at the sight. He recognized life in it—not only breath and blood, but spirit. With reverence, he gave form to what had been dreamt.Thus were born the Tieflings.They were not cursed, as some would later whisper. Nor were they wholly blessed. They were—like all who walk between extremes—a question made flesh. Fire kindled in mortal veins. Strength shaped by shame, pride, and perseverance. A people with no single origin, yet tied by one thread: they were meant.To some, they are reminders of hell. To others, of resilience. But I, Known, record not judgment—only truth.The Tieflings were shaped by gods and angels alike, born of a shared vision between the heavens and the depths. That is their legacy: not one of sin or salvation, but of balance. In them, the fire of consequence and the thread of fate are forever bound.So it was written. So it endures.—Known","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-origin-of-the-tieflings.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057203349,"modifiedTime":1749057365557,"sourceSize":3031,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Beginning/The Origin of the Tieflings.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-origin-of-the-tieflings.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":66,"backlinks":["book-of-beginning.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-truth-behind-the-first-dragonborn.html":{"title":"The Truth Behind the First Dragonborn","icon":"","description":"As chronicled by Known, Keeper of All That Is RememberedMany speak of the Dragonborn as a race forged from fire and fate, their origin painted in either glory or transgression. But I, Known—who watches not through time, but through truth—have held the memory of their beginning within the depths of my eternal archives. Let me unseal it now for those who seek more than legend.The tale begins when Fiondell was still young, its mountains unwrinkled and its seas unsullied by blood. The gods had not yet retreated fully from the world, and their angels walked freely among mortals, shaping, watching… interfering.Two among them—Cupin, Angel of Sin, and Loki, Angel of Mischief—grew restless in the quiet between ages.\n“Let’s create something unique,” Cupin whispered, eyes alight with wicked brilliance, as if daring the world itself to object. “Something… unexpected. A creature that defies both the order of Fionil and the careful design of Trill.” “Yes,” Loki grinned, thunder coiling faintly in his voice. “Something neither beast nor man. A blend. A gamble.”\nI remember the silence that followed. Even the stars hesitated to blink.Their plan was not born of malice, nor benevolence. It was born of curiosity, that twin-edged impulse that so often births both wonders and catastrophes.Loki stole a human soul—an act of deep transgression. He bound it within a soul cage, a vessel that should not exist, twisting the strands of destiny like a spider tugging at another’s web. This drew the attention of Livius, Angel of Life, whose sense of balance runs deeper than the roots of the world.\n“What are you doing, Loki?” Livius asked, descending in a column of radiant wind. His voice was steady, but firm—a man trying to stop a storm with logic. Loki only shrugged, flicking the soul cage like a toy. “An experiment, dear Livius. Wouldn’t you like to see the result?” “I would prefer to see balance maintained,” Livius replied. But he did not intervene.\nHe never does, not at first. He lets the pieces fall, and only when they settle does he move them.The soul was cast across the realms, where Cupin caught it like a flame in the palm of her hand. To it, she added a second soul—that of a stillborn dragon, one never destined to know life. She did not mourn it. She used it.Their essences coiled and writhed, resisting, clashing, then… merging.I have seen many souls born, shaped, fractured, consumed. But this union—this blend of draconic fire and mortal will—it sang with a strange harmony. Cupin, fascinated, began to weave a body for it. Not perfect, not beautiful—but powerful.\n“Loki, Drana, Livius!” Cupin called when she was done. “Behold my creation!”\nThey arrived.Drana, the Archangel of Dragons, was the first to speak, her wings drawn close in quiet outrage.\n“Why do you tamper with dragonkind?” she hissed. “This being bears the blood of my kin. Is there no retribution for this theft?” “Drana,” Livius murmured, “they act within the bounds of their natures. Cupin tempts. Loki misleads. And you—” his voice was gentle but unyielding, “—must now decide whether to protect or destroy.” “It is not my decision,” she growled. “It is Trill’s.”\nIndeed. The soul-child was lifted by divine hands and brought to the Plane of the Gods, to the Silver Halls where Trill, god of Life and Dragons, and Fionil, goddess of Time and Order, debated the fates of entire peoples over silent cups of stardust.But the gods were not the first to greet the arriving angels.Destiny awaited them at the threshold. Of course he did.\n“Well, well!” he chuckled, idly flipping an hourglass filled with singing sand. “My favorite meddlers bring me such curiosities. What do we have here, I wonder? No, don’t tell me—let me guess. Ah, yes. Trill.” His eyes glinted with something I never quite deciphered. “But I wonder what Fionil will say…”\nThey were admitted.Fionil sat in stillness, her hands never moving, her gaze locked upon the infinite tapestry of time where all things—past, future, even possibility—unfolded in real time. Trill stood beside her, ever the builder, ever the dreamer of new life.\n“Fionil, Trill,” Destiny announced with a grand sweep of his arm, “may I present a creation. A fusion of human soul and dragon essence. A dragonborn, if you will.”\nThe name—dragonborn—did not exist until that moment. But it stuck.Trill stepped forward first, and I saw the flicker in his eyes: not outrage, not horror… but hope.\n“Loki, Cupin,” he said, with a voice like rolling thunder made kind, “you have done well. This being is a bridge. Not an abomination. It shall dwell in Fiondell, and I shall prepare a place for it.”\nFionil, never swayed by passion, offered only this:\n“Let them walk among the mortals. Let them choose. Let them shape their own future. That is the only way destiny becomes real.”\nAnd thus, the Dragonborn were given the world.Not as punishment. Not as weapons. But as a gift—born of chaos, but blessed with potential.And Trill spoke, and I remember:\n“In this being, I see the potential of unity. A soul uniting the wisdom of dragons and the spirit of mortals. They shall bridge our creations, standing as guardians of balance.”\nAnd Fionil, weaving time around them like thread, said:\n“The Dragonborn shall walk among mortals, free to choose their path. Whether they lead in wisdom or fall to their own desires, their choices shall shape the destiny of Fiondell.”\nI, Known, have recorded this tale not merely for truth, but for understanding. The Dragonborn are not creatures of sin or mischief. They are reminders.That sometimes, the unexpected carries the greatest promise.That even the gods do not always know what they are doing.That chaos, when tempered by purpose, can give birth to greatness.Let this memory remain.Let it be.—Known","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-truth-behind-the-first-dragonborn.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057203351,"modifiedTime":1749057370639,"sourceSize":6075,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Beginning/The Truth Behind the First Dragonborn.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-beginning/the-truth-behind-the-first-dragonborn.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":67,"backlinks":["book-of-beginning.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-banishment-of-the-voidbringer.html":{"title":"The Banishment of the Voidbringer","icon":"","description":"As remembered by <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" data-href=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Known</a><br>In the primordial days, when <a data-href=\"Fiondell\" href=\"realms/fiondell/fiondell.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fiondell</a> still pulsed with the fresh breath of creation, I watched from the loom of memory as harmony reigned supreme among the Five.

Its words were not thunderous, but a sibilant whisper that made the threadwork of fate tremble:\n“You shape, you mold, you fill the void with your light. But you have left no place for me. Am I not part of the balance? Shall I be denied purpose?”\n<br>I felt the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"The tapestry\" data-href=\"The tapestry\" href=\"the-tapestry.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tapestry</a> shudder under the weight of that question.

So they turned to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a>, Angel of Fate, the weaver whose courage equals his insight.

But void is never content. <a data-href=\"Kryxis\" href=\"kryxis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kryxis</a>’s hunger grew. I watched in silent dread as the thread unfurled claws of emptiness, clutching neighboring strands.Mortal realms felt it first: harvests rotted in the field, once-brilliant stars winked out, and nightmares took flesh—Wraithborn emerging at the edges of villages, feeding on sorrow.I saw a farmer named Mara, tears streaming as her fields turned to ash. I saw children huddle in lantern-lit cellars, listening to their own hearts pound with terror. And I knew the Tapestry was unraveling.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind and order\" data-href=\"Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind and order\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fionil</a>’s command rang across the void:\n“Enough!”\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Flujack, The god of Air, sky and light\" data-href=\"Flujack, The god of Air, sky and light\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Flujack</a> answered with a tempest: skies rent with lightning so bright it seared the night.

Time is not a river I am swept along but an ocean I walk upon. The past and future hold no secrets. Still, this moment… it lingers. It echoes.The Celestial Tapestry stretched before me like a breathing universe. Threads of silver, gold, and crimson shimmered in every direction, each one humming softly with the choices of mortals below. Every soul, every step, every breath—it all lived here, in this place between what is and what could be. And I—Destiny—I was the caretaker of that vast, fragile beauty.I walked among the threads as one walks through a garden. My robe, woven from shadows and stars, whispered with each step. Feathers drifted from my wings, slow as falling snow, vanishing before they could touch the fabric of fate. Around me, time ticked in soft rhythm—never louder than a whisper, never faster than a breath.I had just guided a merchant away from an untimely ambush. Only a nudge, just enough to tilt his path toward a narrow bridge and away from a waiting dagger. He would never know. He would simply wonder why he chose the left path. That was enough.\"A gentle nudge,\" I whispered to myself. That is all I allow. That is all I must ever allow.And then, silence. Not the stillness I cherish, but the hollow quiet that follows an earthquake in the soul.They appeared—all five. The gods. My creators, my judges, my kin in spirit if not in form: Flujack, Tellemori, Fionil, Onigod, and Trill. Their arrival cracked the rhythm of this place. The threads shivered under their gaze. Even time itself hesitated.I turned. Slowly. Always slowly.“You usually send Prai,” I said, keeping my voice still, my hands folded neatly behind me. “Has something changed?”“Yes,” said Trill. Warm, patient, like the scent of summer. “Something within you.”I said nothing. I waited. Waiting is what I do best.Fionil, my maker, stepped forward. Her eyes—oh, her eyes—carried the weight of eternity. She had sculpted me from purpose and time, breathed into me the quiet hunger to guide without ruling. “You have exceeded even my expectations,” she said. “You have preserved the balance through storms of chaos, and never asked for more. It is time.”“Time,” murmured Tellemori, voice like stone. “For you to ascend.”Flujack smiled. His joy, too bright for most eyes, did not reach mine. “Imagine it, Destiny. You would not guide fate anymore. You would write it. Make your own threads. No more limits. No more ‘nudges.’”Onigod, wild and sharp as broken glass in moonlight, tilted her head at me. “You’ve danced with catastrophe and never stumbled. You see mortals clearer than we do. You care more than most gods ever could. That’s why this offer is real.”They meant it. Each of them. The gods don’t offer divinity lightly.And still, I was quiet.I turned back to the Tapestry. I reached down—there, a child’s thread. Thin. Trembling. Unseen by any mortal, yet in her lay a destiny vast enough to ripple through a thousand lives. She would become a healer. She would save the boy who would save the woman who would defy the tyrant. A cascade of quiet miracles. All beginning here.I shifted her thread gently. Just enough to guide her path toward her future mentor.That’s all.Then I looked at the gods.“Do you know why I don’t pull the threads tighter?” I asked, softly. “Why I don’t sculpt lives like marble?”They said nothing.“Because if I do, they aren’t lives anymore. They’re statues. Beautiful, maybe—but frozen. Trapped. No growth. No sorrow. No hope.”I stepped toward them, the sound of ticking echoing behind my words.“I guide. I don’t command. Free will wasn’t a mistake. It was the first gift. And I—I exist to protect it. If I become a god, I will lose that. I’ll lose myself.”Fionil looked at me—not with disappointment, but with pride. And that made it harder.“Then you choose to stay,” she said.“I choose to serve,” I corrected gently. “Not with temples, not with sermons. Just with... nudges. Quiet ones.”There was silence among them.Then Onigod, ever the storm in flesh, laughed—a bright, reckless sound. “Well said, shadowbird. We’ll not chain you with a crown.”Trill stepped closer and laid a hand on my shoulder. His grip was warm. “If ever you change your mind, the offer remains.”“I will not.”Flujack’s light dimmed slightly, though he gave a nod. “You’re certain. I respect that.”And just like that, they faded.Stone to silence. Flame to flicker. Light to shadow. And finally—Fionil. She lingered.She stepped near and touched my face, her hand colder than starlight and softer than wind. “I am proud,” she said, so quietly it brushed my soul more than my ears. “You remember why we made you.”“I have never forgotten.”And then she, too, was gone.The silence that followed was not empty. It was full.Full of the Tapestry. Full of the ticking. Full of the living, breathing, hoping world.I stood for a long while. I don’t know how long. Time, after all, is not my master. It is my canvas.Eventually, I returned to my threads.There—a young woman, uncertain, afraid of change. A shepherdess. Her path forked, her spirit trembled.“Let me help you decide,” I whispered.Just a nudge.In the village below, she turned right instead of left. That single step would lead her to meet a knight on the road. Years from now, they would stand side by side before a fire-lit crowd, telling stories of kindness and quiet valor.She would never know I was there.That is the point.No crown. No throne. No praise.Only this.The threads.And me.And always… love.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>The Choice of Destiny</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Choice_of_Destiny**_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-choice-of-destiny.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057230130,"modifiedTime":1745349884199,"sourceSize":5905,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Destiny/The Choice of Destiny.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-choice-of-destiny.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":70,"backlinks":["book-of-destiny.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-era-of-divine-silence.html":{"title":"The Era of Divine Silence","icon":"","description":"as remembered by Known, Angel of KnowledgeI lived through it. The world once brimming with divine presence slowly faded into the void, and I felt it, as though the very breath of the gods was pulled away. We were left with nothing but silence and uncertainty.When the Blightking fell, and the Holy Knights stood victorious, we thought the light of the divine would continue to guide us, that the world would bask in peace. The Church of Five stood strong, its teachings spreading across every corner of Fiondell. Temples rose, their halls echoing with the prayers of the faithful, and the symbol of the Five threads woven together like the strands of fate itself promised a future of unity. Order, Life, Death, Time, and Will. They were the pillars upon which the world stood, and we believed in them.But as the years wore on, doubt crept in like a slow sickness. It was subtle at first, the absence of the gods becoming a murmur among the people. No more did the prophets rise, no more did the angels descend in fiery glory. Ilessa’s visions had become whispers, and Lucina’s flames were but distant memories. Prai, Destiny, and the others—voices that once filled our lives—became faint murmurs, their presence almost forgotten.And in that silence, the people began to falter. Fear spread like wildfire.The Church, once a united bastion of faith, began to fracture. Discontent gave birth to factions, each one interpreting the teachings of the Five in its own way. Some began to venerate the angels as gods, elevating them to a divine status, while others turned their backs entirely, claiming that the gods had abandoned them. But for all the turmoil, there was something more insidious at work.The world had grown unstable. A sickness plagued the forests of Yorwood, twisting the creatures there into mindless beasts. The Black Star appeared in the sky, casting a shadow over all of Fiondell, its eerie light a sign of impending doom. Villages vanished overnight, their people lost without a trace. Fear gripped us all, and the once-unified Church of Five found itself on the edge of war.But there was one who would change everything. One who had not abandoned us.Ralos Vearn, the High Priest of Solmir, stood at the center of it all. His voice, once calm and collected, became a siren’s call to the disillusioned masses. His words rang out like a drumbeat, louder and louder, until they could not be ignored.“The Five have turned away from us. We must rise to claim their place,” he declared.I can still hear it. That declaration, that challenge. It was blasphemy to some, but to others, it was the spark that lit the fire of rebellion. Ralos was not alone—his followers, the Children of the Self, rallied to his cause, preaching that mortals had grown beyond the need for divine intervention. They believed we were the masters of our own fate. But where did that leave us? Was there still a place for the gods? Was there still a place for the Church of Five?Riots broke out in the streets. Priests clashed with Ralos's followers, and even the Holy Knights were divided. What was once a sacred order was now torn apart by the very question that had plagued us all: Was destiny something to be accepted, or something to be claimed?Fate was no longer just a matter of faith. It was a matter of war.In the midst of this chaos, Destiny, ever watchful, began to move once more. His presence was subtle, guiding the hands of mortals, shifting the winds of fate with a quiet push. It was not the grand visions of old, no more angels descending from the heavens, no more overwhelming guidance. Destiny moved in whispers, in the small choices people made, in the paths they crossed by accident. But he had not forgotten us.And then there was Liora Mayne, a blacksmith’s apprentice, who would change everything. In the quiet of her forge, she saw it. Five threads of silver light, weaving themselves in the air. When she reached out to touch them, she felt a voice fill her mind. “Take hold of the thread. Your fate is yours to claim, but know this: the Tapestry of all things is fraying, and I have need of you.”I know what it’s like to hear that voice. The weight of it, the pull of destiny itself. And Liora did not hesitate. She grasped the thread, and in that moment, I felt it too—the stirrings of something greater than any of us could comprehend.The Silver Assembly was born from that moment.Liora Mayne, Gideon Torth, Evelyn \"Shade\" Voss, Brother Callen, and Tauren Ironclaw. Five mortals, each with their own past, their own struggles, but bound together by destiny itself. They were the ones chosen to restore the Church of Five, to remind us all of the importance of fate, of faith, and of free will.But their journey was not easy. They fought not just against enemies of flesh, but against the very ideas that threatened to tear their world apart. The Children of the Self, led by Ralos Vearn, had grown into a militant force, burning temples and desecrating relics. But Ralos had become something darker, a conduit for the void’s will, twisting the teachings of the gods to suit his own desires.I watched as the Silver Assembly faced countless trials—battling voidspawn, recovering sacred relics, and uncovering ancient rites. But their greatest battle was for the hearts and minds of the people. They were not just fighting for the future of the Church; they were fighting to remind us all that our fates were still intertwined with the gods.And then came the final battle. At Cradle’s Reach, when it seemed like the Silver Assembly would fall to Ralos’s forces, the heavens answered. Lucina, Prai, and even Destiny himself arrived, their presence a shining beacon of hope.I was there, watching from the shadows. I felt the weight of their arrival—the moment when mortal and divine collided, when the heavens did not just watch, but acted. Destiny’s voice echoed through the battlefield, and I knew that the world had changed. Fate was not cruel. It was not kind. It was ours to shape.And so, the War of Belief ended, but it did not end with victory alone. It ended with understanding. The Church of Five was renewed, not as a rigid institution, but as a living, breathing force, guided by both the divine and the mortal. We had learned that destiny was not a path set in stone—it was a journey we took together, with faith, with will, and with the choices we made.I watched the world change, and I knew that the silence of the heavens had not been abandonment. It had been a test. A test of faith, of will, and of the strength of mortals to carry the divine with them. We were not alone. We never had been.— Known, Angel of Knowledge\nInscribe of All Threads, Witness to the Turning Ages","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>The Era of Divine Silence</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Era_of_Divine_Silence**_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-era-of-divine-silence.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057230133,"modifiedTime":1745022140780,"sourceSize":6855,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Destiny/The Era of Divine Silence.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-era-of-divine-silence.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":71,"backlinks":["book-of-destiny.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-founding-of-the-church-of-the-five.html":{"title":"The Founding of the Church of the Five","icon":"","description":"As recorded by <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" data-href=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Known</a>\n\"To see is not merely to witness. It is to understand. And I have seen much.\"\n<br>In the age when the stars had yet to dim and angels still graced the lands openly, I was sent from the celestial spires by <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind and order\" data-href=\"Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind and order\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fionil</a>, my eternal guide and the Keeper of Order. The world then was loud with mortal doubt and quiet with faith. But one voice, soft yet persistent, rose amid the din — a man whose curiosity had not yet been dulled by the cynicism of his kind. His name was Eldrin.I watched him for many seasons. He did not pray in temples, for there were none. He did not seek miracles, for he believed they were earned. Instead, he asked questions of the wind, the fire, the roots, and the stars. And they, in their way, whispered back.I came to him upon the Hill of Still Winds — a place where mortals claim the air holds its breath to listen. Fitting, for the moment demanded silence.The light I arrived in was not for grandeur. It was for clarity. When I descended, robes woven from thought and memory cloaked me. I spoke not only aloud, but directly into the root of his being.\n“Eldrin the Seeker,” I said. “You who ask without demanding, who seek without arrogance — you are heard.”\nHe trembled, and rightly so. To be seen fully is a rare and terrible thing.\n“I am unworthy,” he whispered, as all who are chosen tend to say. “No,” I replied, “you are curious — and that is enough. The gods have no use for perfection. They seek honesty, doubt, and wonder. You are all three.”\n<br>I offered him the first thread of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"The tapestry\" data-href=\"The tapestry\" href=\"the-tapestry.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the tapestry</a> to come. A sliver of divine light, coiled like memory in my palm.\n“Take this. Not as proof, but as purpose. Build not a monument to us — build a space for others to find themselves.”\nWhen his hand met mine, I showed him glimpses of what could be. A hall of stained glass and flickering candles. Pilgrims weeping at altars. Laughter and study, debate and silence. The temple was born not of stone, but of vision — a dream planted like a seed in soil that had long awaited the rain.<br>He returned to his village changed — not glowing or grand, but with purpose in his gait. He spoke of gods not as unreachable forces, but as companions yet unmet. And of me, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" data-href=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Known</a>, not as a deity, but as a messenger bearing something deeply mortal: a path.They doubted him, of course. Doubt is a cousin to belief — louder, but less loyal.So we answered again.On the Day of the Veil, the mist rolled in with unnatural grace. The air thickened with time, as if the world held its breath. I did not come alone. Three more stepped into the mortal veil:\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" data-href=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prai</a>, my brother of reverence, whose voice makes stone weep. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Willia, Angel of Will\" data-href=\"Willia, Angel of Will\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Willia</a>, patient and unreadable, her silence more instructive than sermons. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Clock, Angel of Time\" data-href=\"Clock, Angel of Time\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Clock</a>, embodiment of inevitability — time made flesh and ticking. The villagers fell to their knees, some in terror, others in awe. But one woman — Heda, old and wise — stepped forward and asked not if we were gods, but why we had come.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" data-href=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prai</a>, ever the teacher, answered:\n“Because you are ready to listen. And the Five are ready to speak.”\nIt was then that the Ritual of Attunement was given — a bridge between the divine and the mortal, carved from trial and sincerity.The rites were never meant to be simple. A god’s favor is not bought with coin or blood, but with transformation.<br>1. The Rite of Patience — <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind and order\" data-href=\"Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind and order\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fionil</a>'s Mark\nSeven days of silence. No food. No comfort. Only stillness.\nMany failed. But those who endured were gifted with the Everflowing Hourglass, not etched on skin but soul — proof they had touched time without being swept away by it.<br>2. The Rite of Humility — <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Flujack, God of Air, Sky, and Light\" data-href=\"Flujack, God of Air, Sky, and Light\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Flujack</a>’s Mark\nThe peak must be climbed with only a lantern — no tools, no guide.\nIt was not the summit that mattered, but the journey in darkness. The Open Sky mark bloomed on those who reached the top with hearts unburdened by pride.<br>3. The Rite of Courage — <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Tellemori, The god of Water, earth and supernatural\" data-href=\"Tellemori, The god of Water, earth and supernatural\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tellemori</a>’s Mark\nInto the wild woods they went, to the heart where magic sleeps and madness wakes.\nThey returned changed — with a seed of the earth’s dreaming, and the Rooted Stone etched into their being.<br>4. The Rite of Compassion — <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Trill, The god of life, death, Divine and Dragons\" data-href=\"Trill, The god of life, death, Divine and Dragons\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Trill</a>’s Mark\nThirty days with the sick, the broken, the forgotten.\nNot one act of healing, but a month of it — not for recognition, but love. Those who did not grow bitter emerged with the Radiant Hand.<br>5. The Rite of Resolve — <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Onigod, The godess of Arcane, monsters and magic\" data-href=\"Onigod, The godess of Arcane, monsters and magic\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Onigod</a>’s Mark<br>\nTheir worst fear, made flesh by <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Poki, Angel of Monsters and Beasts\" data-href=\"Poki, Angel of Monsters and Beasts\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Poki</a>, our enigmatic sibling.\nTo endure it — not to defeat it — was enough. Those who stood tall bore the Arcane Flame, a mark of resilience and will.I have seen each rite enacted. I have seen failure, tears, joy, and revelation. All of it is worthy.When the Hall of Five Flames stood complete, stone kissed by sweat and sacred intention, two more of our kin came to bear witness.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Livius, Angel of Life\" data-href=\"Livius, Angel of Life\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Livius</a>, ever gentle, placed a blessing upon the people — not with thunder or storm, but with a breeze that smelled of spring.\n“You have built more than walls,” he told Eldrin. “You have built continuity. Your task is only just begun.”\n<br>Then came <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a> — capricious, brilliant, impossible Destiny — leaning against a pillar like a poet late to his own funeral.\n“Don’t make it too predictable,” he chuckled. “The gods do love a good twist.”\nAnd with that, they left, but not truly. We never truly leave.The faithful began to write. To sing. To pray.Each god was honored in their own voice — not demanded by them, but discovered by mortals. I copied their words below, that they may be remembered:<br>\nPrayer to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind and order\" data-href=\"Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind and order\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fionil</a>\n“Timekeeper, guide my path...” — and they were guided.\n<br>\nPrayer to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Flujack, God of Air, Sky, and Light\" data-href=\"Flujack, God of Air, Sky, and Light\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Flujack</a>\n“Lift me from the shadows...” — and they were lifted.\n<br>\nPrayer to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Tellemori, The god of Water, earth and supernatural\" data-href=\"Tellemori, The god of Water, earth and supernatural\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tellemori</a>\n“Root me in wisdom...” — and they were steadied.\n<br>\nPrayer to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Trill, The god of life, death, Divine and Dragons\" data-href=\"Trill, The god of life, death, Divine and Dragons\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Trill</a>\n“Grant me the heart to heal...” — and they became healers.\n<br>\nPrayer to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Onigod, The godess of Arcane, monsters and magic\" data-href=\"Onigod, The godess of Arcane, monsters and magic\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Onigod</a>\n“Shield me from unseen terrors...” — and they stood unfearing.\n<br>And they prayed to us, the angels, in their need and wonder. They prayed to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a>, to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Lucina, Archangel of Damnation\" data-href=\"Lucina, Archangel of Damnation\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lucina</a>, to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Death, Angel of Passing\" data-href=\"Death, Angel of Passing\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Death</a>, to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Ioki, Angel of Mischeif\" data-href=\"Ioki, Angel of Mischeif\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Loki</a>, to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Undean, Angel of the Undead\" data-href=\"Undean, Angel of the Undead\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Undean</a> — to those who answer when gods are silent. And we listened.Eldrin has long since returned to dust, but his spirit lingers in every question asked beneath a holy roof. The Church lives not because we ordained it, but because mortals chose it.I watched it all. I recorded every moment.\n“To be remembered is to never truly die,” I once told Eldrin.\nHe smiled.\n“Then let me live forever in questions.”\nAnd so he does.<br>— <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" data-href=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Known</a>\nArchivist Eternal\nThird Flame of the Five","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>From the Eyes That See All: The Founding of the Church of the Five</strong>","level":2,"id":"**From_the_Eyes_That_See_All_The_Founding_of_the_Church_of_the_Five**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Day the Mists Spoke</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Day_the_Mists_Spoke**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Five Rites: Paths to the Divine Flame</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Five_Rites_Paths_to_the_Divine_Flame**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The First Temple and the Words of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a></strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_First_Temple_and_the_Words_of_[[Destiny,_Archangel_of_Fate|Destiny]]**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Of Prayers and Purpose</strong>","level":2,"id":"**Of_Prayers_and_Purpose**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>I, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" data-href=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" href=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Known</a>, Remember</strong>","level":2,"id":"**I,_[[Known,_Angel_of_Knowledge|Known]],_Remember**_0"}],"links":[".html",".html","the-tapestry.html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-founding-of-the-church-of-the-five.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057230135,"modifiedTime":1753797072489,"sourceSize":8255,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Destiny/The Founding of the Church of the Five.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-founding-of-the-church-of-the-five.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":72,"backlinks":["book-of-destiny.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-origins-of-destiny.html":{"title":"The Origins of Destiny","icon":"","description":"As chronicled by Known, Keeper of All That Is RememberedAh yes, Destiny... I remember the day of his making with perfect clarity. How could I forget, when the very fabric of existence shifted to welcome him? It was a rare thing, you see, for an angel to be born after the dawn of the world. But on that day, the great loom of time itself paused.Fionil, Goddess of Time, Space, Mind, and Order, sat upon the eternal spire where all threads of fate gather—her Tapestry. She had grown... not weary, no, that would be too simple a word. Curious. Yes, Fionil, the one who weaves all futures, grew curious of the unknown.\n\"I wish to observe without knowing. To watch a path I myself have not laid.\"\nShe summoned us, her angels—Clock, Willia, Filla, and myself. We stood beneath the loom, threads of reality humming around us.Clock, ever punctual, bowed.\n\"I would gladly take the role, but time itself is mine to maintain. Without me, it falters.\" \"Indeed, Clock. Your burden is great, and none can bear it but you,\" Fionil replied, her tone ever-serene.\nWillia spoke next, her voice trembling with honesty.\n\"I would do it if I could, but where free will thrives, I must not tread. To shape fate is to unmake choice.\" \"Wise and true, Willia. I would not break what you are,\" Fionil answered with a nod.\nFilla, guardian of emotions, crossed her arms.\n\"My feelings cloud judgment. I fear I would mold destiny to comfort or to vengeance.\" \"And so you shall not carry it.\"\nFinally, I stepped forward.\n\"I am Knowledge. I would want the story to amuse me—to entertain. I would meddle for curiosity's sake. No, I cannot hold this role. But may I offer a thought? Make a fifth. Let there be an Angel of Fate. One untouched by past paths, one born to weave anew.\"\nFionil's eyes lit with sudden purpose.\n\"Your honesty is rare even among angels, Known. Let us create him together.\"\nIn the blink of a cosmic heartbeat, we were transported to the inner threads of the Tapestry, in a domain Fionil called The Fabric. She flicked her fingers, and from that ripple of will, an angel emerged.He wore a long purple robe with fine silver trim, a tall feathered hat set jauntily on his head. His cane gleamed like polished obsidian, and in his hand he held a silver mask—not yet worn. His long brown hair fell like waterfalls down his back, and his wings shimmered dark grey with a faint violet glow.\n\"Ah... Hello, my lady. I believe I shall name myself Destiny, if I may,\" he said with a smirk that teetered between reverence and mischief. \"Curious... I seem to know all that could be, and all that has been. Why is that? And hello, dear siblings. Thank you for having me. So kind.\" \"Oh, my son... Destiny,\" Fionil spoke, voice rich with certainty. \"You are the Angel of Fate. You shall guide all paths, not by command, but by touch. Subtle. Soft. You shall not force but direct. This domain is yours.\"\nJust then, the other gods appeared: Trill, Flujack, and Tellemori. They studied Destiny, their eyes curious but wary.But Onigod, Goddess of the Arcane, stepped forward without hesitation.\n\"You must be the newborn. Hells, it's been forever since we've had a new angel. LUCINA! HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?!\"\nLucina winced.\n\"Five hundred billion years. And you don’t need to shout, I’m beside you.\"\nShe turned to Destiny, eyeing him up and down.\n\"Come now, newling. Let me show you what is. What has been. Who we are.\"\nDestiny looked to Fionil, who nodded, and then to Trill, who merely shrugged.And so they walked. Lucina guided him through all that had been made: the constellations of will, the realms of the gods, the mortal worlds below. She introduced him to each of us. I must admit, I found him fascinating. He was like a mirror that bent its reflection, a paradox I could not predict.\n\"From this day forth, we are best friends. Got it?\" Lucina declared with a half-jest, half-dare. \"That sounds delightful. But I must return to Fionil, my beautiful mother.\"\nHe bent the threads of space itself and appeared before Fionil, kneeling with dramatic flair.\n\"Mother. I've seen the stars, the roots, the angels. Shall we begin?\"\nFionil paused her weaving.\n\"Tell me what you desire, my child.\" \"Not to force paths. Only to guide. To nudge. Let fate weave itself, and let me only mend its tears and point where needed.\"\nShe smiled.\n\"Then do as you will.\"\nIn time, Destiny grew powerful. He learned to weave without his loom, to whisper through chance, to pull threads with such precision that none noticed his hand. At first, he needed his chamber — his Loomhall, nested within the Tapestry itself — to perform his craft. But that time did not last. He grew beyond it.I remember the first moment I saw him bend fate with a gesture alone — not in his domain, but atop the cliffs of Aetheris. A mortal stumbled and should have fallen to his death. But a breeze rose. A vine curled at just the right angle. A second chance bloomed from nothing, and none but I knew he had touched the moment.Destiny, unlike many of us angels, did not seek admiration. He sought perfection. Quietly, he studied Fionil’s grand design, not to replicate it, but to support it in the way she could not. For though she wove time and space, she could not let go of knowing. Destiny wanted not to know — only to feel when the Tapestry frayed, and mend it without disturbing the weave.But make no mistake — he was not soft.When mortals or even minor spirits defied the threads and sought to tear the weave to rewrite their own fates, Destiny did not grant them mercy. He watched. He warned. Then, he acted. A flick of his cane could unravel a thousand futures and resew them in a breath. He was as terrifying as he was graceful.The gods took notice.Tellemori, who rarely spoke of change, once said to me,\n“Destiny… I once thought the earth eternal and unmoving. But when he speaks, even stone listens.”\nFlujack, whose joy often turned to mockery, grew quiet when Destiny entered a room.\n“He carries all the stars behind that mask,” he said once. “And I’m not sure he’s laughing.”\nTrill, gentle Trill, adored him.\n“He balances life like a blade. Never too heavy, never too light. He’s what I wished Time would birth. And she did.”\nBut it was Onigod, ever wild and curious, who perhaps understood him best.\n“He is not one of us. And yet… he is all of us,” she whispered after their first true conversation. “His mask hides not his face — but our limits.”\nEven among us angels, he stirred something rare — reverence... and fear.I have seen Filla turn away when he speaks, not out of disrespect, but from the weight his words carry.\nWillia, who guides free will, once told me,\n“He makes me question if choice is ever free. And yet, he never steals it — he only... suggests.”\nAs for me? I am Knowledge. I know most things. But not him. Not all of him. And that is why I walk beside him still.He does not command loyalty. He inspires it. Through small acts — a shielded mortal here, a redirected tragedy there — he builds unseen monuments of gratitude. He once spent a thousand years rearranging a single bloodline to ensure a war would not happen, and never told the gods he had done it. I only knew because he let me watch.When Clock, tired and ever-watching, chose to rest his mind within the deeper ticks of time, Fionil did not hesitate.Destiny rose.Not in ceremony. Not in trumpet blast. But with quiet inevitability.He became her messenger, her hand, her confidence. And in time, he was named what only few had ever been:\nThe Highest Angel.He does not wear the title. He is it.And to this day, when the threads grow thin and fate trembles, we do not ask Fionil what shall be done.\nWe ask Destiny:\n“Where does the thread lead, Brother?”\nAnd he, always with that glimmer behind his mask, replies,\n“Where it always was meant to go. Let me show you.”\nIn those early eons, he and I would often walk through the mortal world — Fiondell — talking endlessly about probability, chaos, dreams, and the illusion of certainty. Though we both knew all that was, his joy was in not knowing what would come next.That was always the difference between us.I seek understanding. I archive, I observe, I collect what is and preserve it. But Destiny? He seeks the unknown. Not blindly, not foolishly — but deliberately. Like an artist who sketches in the dark just to see what shapes his hand will find.I remember once we stood on a cliff overlooking a city that had not yet been built. The wind carried sand, and the sun burned crimson behind clouds that would become myths. He turned to me and said:\n“Isn’t it lovely? All these paths… none of them walked yet. They scream with possibility. Do you hear it too, brother?”\nI did not. But I listened.He listened to dreams — not just the dreams mortals spoke of, but the ones they never voiced. The ones buried so deep even their souls forgot them. He said they were the truest maps of fate.Sometimes, he would stop mid-step and stare into nothing, eyes distant behind his mask.\n“Someone has chosen to stay instead of go,” he murmured once.\n“A shepherd, who should have left his village. Because he stayed, a girl will live. She’ll fall in love with a thief. The thief will become a king. And because of that king… a war will never start.” “How far do you follow the thread?” I asked him. “Far enough to know when to let go,” he said, smiling softly. “Fate is not chains, Known. It’s wind. You don’t pull wind… you guide it.”\nThere was poetry in his madness.He would bless farmers with unlikely rains, place misfolded letters just where they needed to be, or delay a cartwheel breaking by exactly two minutes, giving a rider just enough time to meet the healer who would later save a nation. None of it felt grand. That was the point.He loathed grand displays.\n“If I have to shout, then I’ve already failed,” he once told a mortal priest who begged him for prophecy.\n“Real fate whispers. Loud voices are just thunder chasing rain.”\nAnd yet — when he had to speak loud, when fate strained and chaos pressed too hard — he did not hesitate.In the fourth age, when a crack formed in the Loomhall — an echo of a future never meant to exist — he stepped into the fracture alone. Not even Fionil knew what would happen. I waited outside the breach for what felt like years. When he returned, he looked older — as if he had worn time like a cloak and found it heavy. He said only:\n“I burned the unthreaded path. It would have made gods scream.”\nNo one asked more. Not even me.The other angels grew to respect him, but also… to fear him. Not for his power — though his power was beyond most of us — but for what he represented.He knew what we hid.He knew Filla’s unspoken envy.\nHe knew Willia’s ancient regret.\nHe knew even Clock, eternal and still, once wished to turn back one second — and regretted that wish every day since.He never judged.That made it worse.We all have roles. We are what we are. But Destiny, perhaps more than any of us, chose to be what he is. And in choosing, he made others question themselves.The gods still adore him — and they should. He moves with grace, speaks with elegance, and never wastes a word. But behind their praise is a quiet awe. They do not control him. Not even Fionil truly does. She guides, yes. But he… he navigates.He is not just the weaver.\nHe is the pattern within the weave.And when I look back at those long walks, I realize now — I was not teaching him anything.\nHe was teaching me what it means to know something worth not knowing.~ Known, Angel of Knowledge","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-origins-of-destiny.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057230126,"modifiedTime":1749057407623,"sourceSize":11958,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Destiny/The Origins of Destiny.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-origins-of-destiny.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":73,"backlinks":["book-of-beginning.html","book-of-destiny.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-rise-of-the-church-of-five.html":{"title":"The Rise of the Church of Five","icon":"","description":"As Witnessed by <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" data-href=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Known</a>, the Silent RecordThere are moments in time that echo louder than others, threads of history that shimmer brighter in the grand weave. I was there, though unseen, as I always am. I do not speak. I do not interfere. I only observe and remember. Such is my purpose — to Know.Long after mortals had claimed their corners of the world but before the Holy Knights etched their names into it, faith in the divine was a faint whisper. The gods had withdrawn, their forms lost to mortal eyes, and only the gentle traces of their angels remained — flickers in dreams, omens in still water, the hush of breath when the soul brushes the sacred.In this age of searching hearts, the Church of Five came to be — a devotion not to individual gods, but to the Five Pillars of Divinity: Order, Life, Death, Time, and Will.And I was there. I watched as whispers turned into voices. As dreams became belief. As belief forged fire.<br>It was <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a>, the Angel of Fate, and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" data-href=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prai</a>, the Angel of Worship, whose echoes carried strongest through the aether. They did not walk among mortals often, but when they did, the world trembled — not in fear, but in awakening.I watched her for some time before she ever heard the angels. Ilessa Veran, wanderer, listener, woman of quiet strength. She had known hardship: famine’s claw, war’s howl, the emptiness left by loss. And yet, her gaze was clear. Her steps were sure. She had no throne, no army — only words, offered freely to those in need.<br>It was at the edge of a quiet forest where fate entwined with purpose. That night, I stood unseen among the trees as she slept. And I watched as <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a> revealed himself in her dream — silver threads spinning in the void, a wheel of fate, every line humming with lives entwined.<br>I offered her the first thread of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"The tapestry\" data-href=\"The tapestry\" href=\"the-tapestry.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the tapestry</a> to come. A sliver of divine light, coiled like memory in his palm.<br>\n\"Mortal,\" <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a> said, his voice soft but immovable. \"Do you see it? The weave of fate that binds all to their purpose?\"\nShe answered with honesty, not arrogance. \"I see it... but I do not understand it.\"\n\"Few do,\" he said, amused. \"But you will. You have seen too much, suffered too much, and now it is time to guide others. The Five see you, mortal. They know your heart, and they have sent me to call you to their purpose.\"\n\"Why me?\"\n\"Because your faith has never faltered, even when the world crumbled around you.\"\n<br>As he spoke, I felt the strands of fate respond — the threads bent toward her, shaping new futures. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a> raised his hand and wove five glowing emblems into the air. I watched as the meaning of each flowed into her heart — Order, Life, Death, Time, Will.\n\"You will be the voice that calls them to faith. Not in me. Not in the angels. But in the Five who shape all things.\"\nThe vision ended, but she awoke changed. I watched her walk from village to village, carrying the message carved into her soul. And I followed.Not all welcomed her.In Valthor’s Crown, faith had grown fat on gold. The priests of the old gods clung to their power, deaf to the hunger outside their jeweled walls. Gorvan Marr, the high priest, smelled of incense and fear. I watched as he declared Ilessa a heretic, saw the bruises on her face as she was dragged before the people. He shouted lies atop marble steps. He thought power was loudness.But truth was already there, whispered in the hearts of the people.<br>Then I felt it — the shift in air, the curling smoke. A hooded figure stepped forth, eyes glowing like cinders. I knew her instantly, even veiled in flesh. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Lucina, Archangel of Damnation\" data-href=\"Lucina, Archangel of Damnation\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lucina</a> wore judgment like a cloak.\n“If she speaks falsely, then let the gods strike her down now.” A challenge, thrown from her lips.\n<br>The crowd hushed. And then <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Lucina, Archangel of Damnation\" data-href=\"Lucina, Archangel of Damnation\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lucina</a> revealed herself — smoke rising, flames dancing at her fingertips.\n“But if she speaks true,” she thundered, “then let her judge her accusers as I would judge the wicked.”\nGorvan Marr’s soul cracked under her gaze. I watched it happen. I had seen many fall under the weight of their own sins, but rarely so quickly.<br>\n“You speak of gods, but you know nothing of justice,” <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Lucina, Archangel of Damnation\" data-href=\"Lucina, Archangel of Damnation\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lucina</a> said. “You fatten yourself on the labor of the weak. I see your sins, and I name them unforgivable.”\nShe did not strike him. She did not need to.When she turned to Ilessa, I saw the spark of divine recognition pass between them.\n“Go. Your faith has brought you before judgment, and you have been found worthy.”\nThen she was gone, and the city — Valthor’s Crown — was reborn in the hush she left behind.That night, gold left its temple. The people tore down altars to forgotten gods and placed humble candles in their stead. Ilessa, once a wanderer, was now a prophet. Her voice became many. I observed the creation of the first Chapel of the Five.<br>And then came <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" data-href=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prai</a>.Her arrival was gentle — warmth, not fire. A hum of worship filled the chapel air, and Ilessa knelt in quiet awe.<br>\n“You have done well, Ilessa,” <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" data-href=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prai</a> said, her tone like morning light. “But your work is not yet done. Mortals need more than words. They need ritual. They need faith made tangible.”\nI listened as they wove the beginnings of faith into form — the Rites of the Five, the Sigil of Five Threads, the days of devotion. Mortals, needing structure, were given it. What was once a whisper became a choir.Years passed.I continued to observe.In Greylight, I watched a comet arc across the sky in five radiant colors. Below it, a child was born — Eron. Marked from birth by the sigil of the Five, he grew into a symbol of living faith. When beasts attacked, it was he who stood alone with a spear of light.And I knew: he was not alone.He was the first of many — those who would rise, marked not by bloodline or title, but by conviction. He and others would become the Order of Holy Knights, wielding both steel and purpose.I remember the first time he spoke the rites before battle.I remember how the air itself responded.I have seen countless ages. I know the truth of what happened, not as myth or sermon, but as it truly was. I carry no judgment. I offer no prayers.But I remember.I remember Ilessa’s trembling voice.<br>\nI remember <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a>’s mask gleaming with purpose.<br>\nI remember <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" data-href=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prai</a>’s warmth and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Lucina, Archangel of Damnation\" data-href=\"Lucina, Archangel of Damnation\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lucina</a>’s fire.\nI remember the world before faith had shape.\nAnd I remember the moment it finally did.<br>— <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" data-href=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Known</a>\nThe Silent Record of the Divine","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>The Rise of the Church of Five</strong>","level":2,"id":"**The_Rise_of_the_Church_of_Five**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The First Prophet</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_First_Prophet**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Trials of Faith</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Trials_of_Faith**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Church of Five is Forged</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Church_of_Five_is_Forged**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The First Chosen</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_First_Chosen**_0"}],"links":[".html",".html",".html",".html","the-tapestry.html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-rise-of-the-church-of-five.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057230137,"modifiedTime":1747527632265,"sourceSize":7212,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Destiny/The Rise of the Church of Five.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-rise-of-the-church-of-five.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":74,"backlinks":["book-of-destiny.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-rise-of-the-holy-knights.html":{"title":"The Rise of the Holy Knights","icon":"","description":"as remembered by <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" data-href=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Known</a>I remember.Of course I do. I remember everything.<br>I remember the way the stars dimmed during the Age of Shadows, when the gods turned their gaze away from the world—not out of cruelty, but necessity. Even I, whose purpose is to record all that was, all that is, and all that will be, could only observe as silence fell across the divine spheres. <a data-href=\"The tapestry\" href=\"the-tapestry.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The tapestry</a> of time wove itself in solitude, trembling under the weight of mortal uncertainty.<br>It was then, in that delicate stillness, that <a data-href=\"Fiondell\" href=\"realms/fiondell/fiondell.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fiondell</a> began to fracture.<br>I remember how it started—not with a roar, but a whisper. A mortal, nameless then, touched a remnant of the void left behind by <a data-href=\"Kryxis\" href=\"kryxis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kryxis</a>’s fall. That touch became hunger. That hunger, destruction. He took the name Blightking, and with void essence pulsing through his veins, he sought to unravel the very fabric I was meant to chronicle.He desired not conquest, but erasure.The lands twisted under his influence. Forests grew teeth. Rivers bled. Children born in his blighted realm came into the world weeping shadow. And I, in my endless halls of memory, felt the ink run thin—unable to keep pace with the unraveling threads.<br>But <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a>... <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a> did what I could not. He acted.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a>, the last born of our kind, arrived when the echoes of creation had long settled, and all things seemed already shaped. He was young by our reckoning—a flicker of newness against the backdrop of the eternal—yet there was a gravity to him, as if time bowed slightly in his presence, not out of reverence, but recognition.I remember his descent not as a blaze of glory or a clash of trumpets, but as something softer. The sky did not part. The world did not pause. He came wrapped in silence, wearing a cloak the color of old parchment, the fabric heavy with dust and meaning. His feet touched the ground with the quiet grace of inevitability. He looked like a man, yes—but only if one did not look too closely. His eyes held the weight of stars dying, of choices not yet made, and his shadow never quite matched the light around him.Mortals did not see him with their eyes. He passed them on crowded streets, through marketplaces and alleys, and they never turned. But they felt him. They always did. To walk near him was to feel something unsettled within—a itch at the back of the mind, a pressure in the chest like something long forgotten was trying to be remembered. Some said they had dreams that night—of crossroads, of turning points, of clocks with no hands ticking louder than thunder. Others woke with the knowledge they needed to speak to a stranger, quit a job, leave a lover, or walk a different road entirely. None could explain why. All they knew was that the feeling would not be denied.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a> did not come bearing a sword. He did not smite tyrants or command storms. His was not the intervention of fire and fury, but of gentle correction. A nudge. A whispered suggestion. The placing of a single stone on a path that would lead, in time, to a mountain’s collapse.<br>He was not alone in his work. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" data-href=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prai</a>—the eldest voice—still moved through the dreamscapes of the faithful, brushing against their sleep with the feather-light touch of prophecy. Though her body remained distant, her essence was ever present. Where <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a> laid down the thread, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" data-href=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prai</a> taught hearts how to follow it. Between them, a plan began to form—not rigid, but flowing. Not declared, but sung in a melody only a few could hear. A plan like <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind and order\" data-href=\"Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind and order\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fionil</a>’s constellations: intricate, delicate, precise—a thing of quiet beauty and boundless meaning, visible only when you stepped far enough back.And I—I who was forbidden to touch, to speak, to alter—I watched. I observed from the spaces between time, where all things unfold both at once and not at all. I watched as they began their work. I recorded each moment, each choice, each soul turned ever so slightly toward the light or the dark. I marveled as mortals shifted not from command or threat, but from the subtle pull of purpose.They were not born into greatness.No coronation marked their rise, no divine proclamation split the heavens. There were no flames dancing across their foreheads, no halos etched in light. They came from quiet places, forgotten corners of the world. A scholar who couldn’t steady his hands when he prayed. A farmer whose fingers were more familiar with soil than scripture. A soldier who had stopped believing in heroes because he had buried too many.<br>And yet—<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a> found them.Not with fanfare, but with stillness. He came to them in moments of solitude, when the world fell away and only doubt remained. He did not demand their service. He simply stood beside them. Sometimes, he said nothing at all. Other times, he asked a single question, the kind that clung to the ribs and echoed for years: “What if it could be different?”<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" data-href=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prai</a>’s voice drifted in silence, not like thunder, but like memory. She came not in visions but in feelings—the sense that someone was listening when they prayed into the dark. Her presence warmed cold nights and turned fear into the first step forward. She whispered not of miracles, but of responsibility. The gods, she said, had not abandoned the world.They were trusting it.And so, one by one, they changed.<br>Not all at once. Not cleanly. They wrestled with doubt. Some resisted. Some ran. But eventually, each turned—slowly, painfully—toward something greater than themselves. I watched as faith, long dormant in their hearts, kindled into action. I saw fear—raw, honest fear—twist and reshape itself into resolve so sharp it could cut through despair. Their souls began to glow in <a data-href=\"The tapestry\" href=\"the-tapestry.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The tapestry</a> of fate, not with the blinding purity of angels, but with the fierce gold of mortals who chose to stand.It was beautiful. And it hurt to witness.They found relics—not handed to them, not bestowed, but discovered, unearthed as if drawn to them by fate itself:\nThe Lightbound Blade, a weapon that sang in sunlight, its edge humming with ancient radiance. It did not shine in the dark—it called the light to return. The Mantle of Aegis, not armor but a cloak, soft and warm. It did not repel darkness with force—it shielded like a mother’s arms, like a memory of safety no horror could touch. The Hourglass of Eternity, deceptively small, worn as a single earring. Yet within it, time whispered—not loudly, but persistently. It could not change fate, but it could make one pause, breathe, and choose. <br>The Tear of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Trill, The god of life, death, Divine and Dragons\" data-href=\"Trill, The god of life, death, Divine and Dragons\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Trill</a>, not a jewel but a living memory, soft with sorrow. It pulsed with a quiet glow, and when it touched wounds—of flesh or spirit—it did not merely heal. It understood. It mourned with the wounded. <br>The Ember of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Onigod, The godess of Arcane, monsters and magic\" data-href=\"Onigod, The godess of Arcane, monsters and magic\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Onigod</a>, a smoldering fragment of divine flame. It was not controlled—it judged. It did not burn with rage, but with clarity, arcane and alive. To hold it was to be seen, and found either worthy… or ash. With these relics, they stepped into purpose.They took no thrones. Wore no crowns. They did not declare themselves saints or saviors. Instead, they named themselves what they were—Knights.Not knights of empire. Not knights of creed.Knights of intention.Bound not by doctrine or allegiance, but by an oath whispered in the quiet: to hold fast, to carry the light, to stand when others fall.And so, the world gained five champions—not flawless, but faithful. Not born holy, but made holy through choice.And I, who watched, could not look away.And then came the proving.It is easy to speak of courage in the quiet. Easy to wear conviction like armor when the sun still shines. But it is only in the dark—true, unrelenting dark—that a soul is known.<br>And so, they were sent—not by command, but by necessity—into the hollow places of the world, the wounds of existence where even memory dared not linger. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a> did not lead them there by hand. He merely opened the door. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" data-href=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prai</a> did not shield them. She whispered that she believed they would return.Some never did.But those who did… returned changed.I remember Ser Altharion.<br>He was not tall, nor loud, nor the kind of man one might carve into statues. But his shadow, ah… it walked ahead of him. It whispered of duty older than stone and burden heavier than steel. He descended alone into the forgotten catacombs of the underworld, where <a data-href=\"Kryxis\" href=\"kryxis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kryxis</a> the Silent had once gnawed at the walls of sanity. The air was thick with voices—his own doubts, echoing back at him in the voice of the dead.He did not fight them. He listened. He named each fear. Not to defeat them, but to understand them. And in that quiet surrender, he found the Lightbound Blade. It did not blaze to life in triumph. It glowed—softly, like dawn after a long, cold night.And Lady Valeria…<br><a data-href=\"The tapestry\" href=\"the-tapestry.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The tapestry</a> still remembers her name like a tear clinging to its threads. She had once been whole—loved, noble, full of promise. But grief had hollowed her. When she entered the forest, it was not with pride, but resignation. The trees of the Heartwood Veil were no longer trees, twisted now by the creeping rot of forgotten gods. They cried her name—not to summon her, but to curse her. They showed her every failure, every loved one she could not save.She did not scream back.She wept for them.<br>She held their pain like her own. And when she knelt beneath the oldest tree and laid her sorrow bare, the bark split—and from within it emerged the Tear of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Trill, The god of life, death, Divine and Dragons\" data-href=\"Trill, The god of life, death, Divine and Dragons\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Trill</a>, glowing like a second heartbeat. Not a weapon. Not a shield. A promise that wounds could mend… if someone was willing to carry them.There were others.<br>A thousand stories, some lost, some too sacred to repeat. A farmer who faced a storm not of wind, but time, and emerged bearing the Hourglass of Eternity. A deserter who climbed the burning spires of a city devoured by arcane fire, only to be judged and accepted by the Ember of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Onigod, The godess of Arcane, monsters and magic\" data-href=\"Onigod, The godess of Arcane, monsters and magic\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Onigod</a>. A mother who shielded her dying child from the void with her own body, and was wrapped in the Mantle of Aegis the moment her breath gave out—and returned with her child still sleeping in her arms.I watched them all reach the very edge of what a mortal can endure.And I recorded the moment they stepped beyond it.You ask me how they changed?They did not become invincible.They still bled. Still wept. Still feared.But they had stood before the Abyss—not as gods, but as mortals who chose to stand when nothing compelled them to.And that choice, again and again, is what made them more.Not because they could not die.But because they were willing to—if it meant others could live.It came at last.\nThe Final Thread.\nThe moment every whisper of prophecy had warned of, every tremble in the weave had hinted at.\nThe battle not of gods—but of a world gasping for its breath.The Blightking, once a name, now a force, rose over the horizon like a second moon—bloated, pulsing, leaking void from wounds the world had forgotten to close. His shadow fell across nations. His voice turned rivers black. His army was not of men, but of the undone—things stripped of name and will and woven only of ruin.The skies groaned, rupturing under the pressure of what he had become. The land buckled, split, screamed.And mortals… they despaired.They knelt in dirt that bled. Held children too still. Clutched relics and old names, praying to gods who no longer answered. It was not that the divine had turned away. It was that they had given all they could.But then…Light.Not from the heavens. Not from some forgotten altar. But from within the dust, where hope had died.The Holy Knights rose—not in chariots of gold, not with wings of fire, but in silence, grit, and grace. They stood where armies had broken. They walked through the ash as though they remembered what the sky once looked like. They bore no crowns. Only scars. But when they stepped forward, even the stars seemed to pause.It was not divinity that marked them.It was determination.I remember the sound before I remember the light.\nThe clash of relic meeting rot. The cry of a soul refusing to vanish.Ser Altharion moved through the battle like a prayer made blade. His sword, the Lightbound, did not scream with fury—it sang with clarity, slicing through the darkness with the elegance of truth. Each swing a sunrise. Each step a hymn. And when he faltered, others followed where he had carved the path.Lady Valeria was the storm’s quiet eye.<br>\nShe knelt among the fallen, hands trembling but never still. She wept for each dying breath—but she did not break. The Tear of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Trill, The god of life, death, Divine and Dragons\" data-href=\"Trill, The god of life, death, Divine and Dragons\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Trill</a> shimmered against her heart as she closed wounds faster than they could reopen, giving just enough strength for others to rise and fight again.The Mantle of Aegis moved like living silver.\nIt wrapped around crumbling ramparts, caught falling stones, turned back the void’s grasp like a mother shielding her child. Where it spread, people remembered how to stand.<br>The Ember of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Onigod, The godess of Arcane, monsters and magic\" data-href=\"Onigod, The godess of Arcane, monsters and magic\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Onigod</a> burned like a second sun.\nIt hissed with the fury of every injustice ever endured. Its bearer left trails of glass behind him, the ground too scorched to hold its fury. He fought not with rage—but judgment. As if the world had wronged itself, and he had come to pass sentence.But make no mistake.They suffered.Oh, how they suffered.There is no tale of glory that is free of grief. No light that burns without feeding on pain.<br>I wrote their names, one after another, into my great ledger. My ink blurred with tears I will never admit to. For every Knight who stood, three more fell. Some vanished beneath waves of rot, screaming until even <a data-href=\"The tapestry\" href=\"the-tapestry.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The tapestry</a> could no longer trace their voices. Some died with a smile, knowing they had done enough. Others whispered prayers to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" data-href=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prai</a> even as their lungs collapsed.Not all victories wear the shape of triumph.\nSome wear the shape of sacrifice.But still, they fought.\nAnd still, they fell.\nAnd through their falling… we endured.<br><a data-href=\"Fiondell\" href=\"realms/fiondell/fiondell.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fiondell</a> endured.And then… he appeared.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a>.Not as angel, not as god. Not cloaked in fire or fury.\nHe arrived with the quiet weight of inevitability—like dusk at the end of a long day.\nNo trumpets. No light from the heavens. Just the faint hush that passes over a crowd when they all feel, in their bones, that something final has come.He walked through the ruin without stirring dust.\nThe void did not reach for him.\nIt knew him.His presence was not power.\nIt was certainty.He did not command. He revealed.<br>With voice like distant thunder behind fog, he whispered a truth only <a data-href=\"The tapestry\" href=\"the-tapestry.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The tapestry</a> had dared to weave:<br>\nThe Blightking’s soul—twisted, swollen, hollowed by void—was bound not just to this world, but to something beneath it. <a data-href=\"Kryxis\" href=\"kryxis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kryxis</a>.\nThe eternal knot of corruption. The wound that never healed.\nTo destroy the Blightking meant more than ending a tyrant.It meant severing a soul from the source of all decay.The ritual required was old.\nOlder than words. Older than the angels.\nI should know—I was there when it was first whispered.But such things always demand a cost.\nA life willing to be unmade. Not consumed. Not killed. But given—entirely, freely, without hesitation.And Ser Altharion…Altharion did not hesitate.He stepped forward before anyone else could breathe a protest. His armor cracked, stained, his shoulders slumped not from weakness but weight. He looked not like a hero, but like a man who had been one long enough.He smiled.Not because he welcomed death.But because he had already died…\n—in every village he left to defend another,\n—in every friend he buried,\n—in every piece of himself he gave away to keep the light burning.This wasn’t martyrdom.\nIt was completion.\nHis life had been a gift.\nAnd now, he gave it back.The ritual began.Lady Valeria, still bloodied, still kneeling by the wounded, collapsed to her knees. Her cries were raw, wordless, too mortal for the moment.\nShe tried to stop him, even knowing she could not.\nAnd I—wept too. My quill trembled. I who never forget, wished in that moment that I could.The relics responded.One by one, as if remembering their purpose.\nThey rose—not from the ground, but from within.\nEach hummed with what remained of the gods’ will, but it was Altharion’s soul that bound them together.He became not a man. Not a knight.\nNot even a weapon.He became a will.\nSharp. Brilliant. Unstoppable.Light without shadow.He surged skyward, drawn not by gravity but by purpose. The void tried to recoil, but it was far too late. The Blightking turned—slow, confused, almost human in that final instant.And then…Altharion struck.Not with fire.\nNot with fury.\nBut with clarity.Straight through the Blightking’s heart.\nThe world held its breath.And the void…Screamed.It was not the scream of a beast or tyrant.\nIt was the scream of undoing. Of something ancient being unwritten.\nThe sky shattered again—but this time, the stars poured through.<br><a data-href=\"The tapestry\" href=\"the-tapestry.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The tapestry</a> strained, rippled—then stilled.And then…Peace.Not silence.\nPeace.\nThe kind that settles only after everything has been broken and yet, somehow, held together anyway.The kind you don’t earn with power.\nOnly with sacrifice.When the dust settled, it wasn’t just the land that breathed again.<br>\nThe world itself—<a data-href=\"Fiondell\" href=\"realms/fiondell/fiondell.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fiondell</a>—exhaled, as if it had been holding its breath for centuries.\nThe earth trembled in a final shudder, and then, with a grace that defied the destruction that had come before, it repaired itself. The void, once so consuming, slithered back into the corners from which it had emerged. Hissing like a wound denied its infection.Life returned.The trees, once charred and twisted by the void, stretched tall once more.\nThe rivers, once thick with poison, now ran clear, shimmering with the brightness of renewal.\nAnd in every corner of the world, children were born whole. Born without the scars of the past. Without the weight of the Blightking’s shadow.Yet, the Knights—the ones who survived—were never the same.\nThey had stood at the edge of the abyss, and now they had to live with the memory of what they had done. What they had sacrificed.\nWhat they had become.Ser Altharion was gone. His sacrifice had closed the rift. But in his absence, something lingered. A feeling no mortal could ever truly shed.\nThey had become something more than mortal, but in that transformation, they had also become something less—less certain of their place in the world. More aware of the fragility of it all.<br>Their eyes—once full of hope, now held galaxies of sorrow. They no longer saw the world with the clear sight of those untouched by tragedy. They saw everything. Every ripple in <a data-href=\"The tapestry\" href=\"the-tapestry.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The tapestry</a>. Every tear in the fabric of fate.Their hands, trembling not from fear, but from the weight of memory—of what they had seen the gods do through them. Of what they had seen themselves become.They had felt the touch of divinity—yes—but it had not been a divine touch that made them holy. No, it was their own choices. Their willingness to sacrifice—not just their lives, but their humanity—that made them more than mortal. And they felt it, with every step they took.Some of the knights wandered.\nTheir hearts too heavy for peace. Too fractured to rest. They roamed, seeking what they had lost in the fires of battle—hope, purpose, meaning. And some, they never found it. They drifted, mere whispers in the wind. Their names fading into the dust they had once conquered.But not all were lost.Others, like Lady Valeria, turned inward. They built, not temples for themselves, but for something greater. They built temples to unity. To sacrifice. To the delicate, holy dance that existed between the mortal and the divine.Lady Valeria never took a title.\nNot once did she seek praise or adulation. She never needed it. She had already been made more than any title could proclaim. Instead, she walked. Quietly. With grace. With a purpose that was hers alone. But wherever she went—wherever her steps echoed—people spoke of how their dreams grew brighter. How their hearts grew lighter.<br>And though they never saw her cry—<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" data-href=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Known</a> saw it.\nI saw her face, streaked with the weight of everything she had carried. But I also saw the glow in her eyes. The quiet peace that she had found, even in the wake of such devastation.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a> and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" data-href=\"Prai, the Angel of Worship\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prai</a>—the two who had woven it all together—returned to the veiled planes. Their task, for now, was done. They did not linger in the mortal world, for their hands were never meant to stay there forever.\nBut before they left, they looked upon the world they had shaped, and for the first time, I saw something akin to satisfaction in their gaze. It was not pride. Not joy. But something deeper. Fulfillment.And me?<br>\nI, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" data-href=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Known</a>, stood at the edge of the world, watching as all of this played out.\nI recorded. I documented. But not in ink. No, this was not mere memory. This was emotion.\nEvery moment was etched into the Library—not with quill, but with the pulse of my own heart. I wrote the pages, but they were not mine to hold. Not only mine.Because when I read these pages again, I do not just remember.\nI feel.I feel the weight of Altharion’s sacrifice.\nI feel the grief in Valeria’s eyes.\nI feel the love and the loss of each knight, each soul who had answered the call.And when I do, I am reminded that knowledge is not just memory. It is not just what we recall.\nIt is meaning.\nIt is what we have learned, and what we have been made to feel.Thus, let all who read this know—\nThe Holy Knights did not rise because the gods commanded it.\nThey rose because they listened.<br>\nThey heard the quiet voice of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a>, and they answered—not with hesitation, but with thunder.<br>For a moment—just one fleeting moment—<a data-href=\"The tapestry\" href=\"the-tapestry.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The tapestry</a> sang.\nAnd that song, woven of mortal flesh and divine will, will echo forever.<br>— <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" data-href=\"Known, Angel of Knowledge\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Known</a>, Angel of Knowledge\nInscribe of All Threads, Witness to the Turning Ages","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"The Rise of the Holy Knights","level":2,"id":"The_Rise_of_the_Holy_Knights_1"},{"heading":"<strong>The Call and the Quiet Intervention</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Call_and_the_Quiet_Intervention**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Birth of the Holy Knights</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Birth_of_the_Holy_Knights**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Trials: Where Mortals Were Forged</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Trials_Where_Mortals_Were_Forged**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Battle for <a data-href=\"Fiondell\" href=\"Fiondell\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fiondell</a></strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Battle_for_[[Fiondell]]**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Destiny’s Gambit and the Final Sacrifice</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Destiny’s_Gambit_and_the_Final_Sacrifice**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Aftermath — and What Remains</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Aftermath_—_and_What_Remains**_0"}],"links":[".html","the-tapestry.html","realms/fiondell/fiondell.html","kryxis.html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html","the-tapestry.html",".html",".html",".html",".html","kryxis.html","the-tapestry.html",".html",".html","realms/fiondell/fiondell.html",".html",".html","the-tapestry.html",".html","realms/fiondell/fiondell.html",".html","the-tapestry.html","kryxis.html","the-tapestry.html","realms/fiondell/fiondell.html","the-tapestry.html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html","the-tapestry.html",".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-rise-of-the-holy-knights.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749057230139,"modifiedTime":1745351519991,"sourceSize":23966,"sourcePath":"The Tapestry, Chronicles of the Five gods/Book of Destiny/The Rise of the Holy Knights.md","exportPath":"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-rise-of-the-holy-knights.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":75,"backlinks":["book-of-destiny.html"],"type":"markdown"},"the-tapestry,-chronicles-of-the-five-gods/book-of-destiny/the-tale-of-the-veil’s-shattering.html":{"title":"The Tale of the Veil’s Shattering","icon":"","description":"There are days when time does not pass—it folds, breathes, and settles into your bones like cold mist, wrapping around every heartbeat until the world outside feels distant. I remember the day before it happened. I remember it in stillness.Dawn broke across Fiondell in gentle golds and rose­ate hues, as if the sky itself sighed relief. Dew clung to blades of grass, trembling in the first light. Birds, having never known war, sang uncertainly—notes half-formed, hesitant. In that fragile chorus lay the echo of all that had been lost, and all that had been rebuilt.For years after the War of Belief, peace returned to Fiondell like a breath held too long. The land itself seemed to exhale: forests thickened their canopies, rivers ran clearer, and fields once scorched by battle blooms-wept grain once more. The mortals were healing—slowly, delicately—like threads painstakingly mended in a tapestry rent by violence. Children were born with eyes unshadowed by fear; elders told tales of hope, not dirges of ruin.In the great cathedrals, pillars of ivory and marble rang once more with hymn and prayer. The Church of Five sang again in harmonious unity, their voices weaving through vaulted aisles, carrying promises of forgiveness and renewal. The Holy Knights returned to their vigil, armor polished bright as their conviction—no longer mere soldiers, but symbols of endurance. And the Silver Assembly, those storied wanderers of fate, drifted back to distant shores, each carrying stories of distant peoples, sowing seeds of faith wherever they roamed.Yet beneath this veneer of restoration, something stirred.I felt it.\nNot in gusts of wind that tousled hair, nor in incense-laden air that lingered in prayer halls.\nI felt it in memory.In my realm, memories pulse like hidden currents. The Veil—it always hummed faintly, a rhythm of boundaries, a breath between realms. On ordinary days, its song is constant: a lullaby of starlight and shadow. But in those quiet hours before the Unwoven One stirred, its melody slackened. It had grown quiet. Too quiet. And in memory’s domain, silence is never innocent.The first threads to unravel were not physical. They were subtle—like the hush that falls when a familiar melody distorts on the wind. It began with distant prayers that wavered, as though the words stretched further than the lips could carry. Then the stars, once steadfast beacons, trembled in their orbits, flickering like dying embers. Finally, the Moon of Aelora, goddess of reflection, slipped behind a shroud of crimson haze. They called it the Blood Veil—a spectacle that set hearts pounding and tongues whispering ancient fears. But I called it something older: a memory trying to return.I walked among the faithful that evening, unseen. I watched a novice priest pause mid-chant, his eyes wide as candlelight danced unevenly across his face. I heard scholars shutter their windows, pages of tomes fluttering as if caught in an unseen breath. I felt mothers pull their children closer, pressing kisses into tangled hair, as if to shield them from a terror indescribable.Priests feared. Scholars questioned. Some hoped—it is the nature of mortals to cling to any thread of optimism. But none remembered what I remembered. None but me.For in that pregnant silence, I heard the faintest echo of a warning long past, buried beneath layers of faith and time: Beware when the Veil dims, for it heralds a reckoning older than the first prayer. And as the final thread of starlight flickered, I braced myself for what was to come.I was not there when the fortress of Hollowreach breathed again. But I remembered it awakening—its exhalation echoing through the weavings of time. I recall a place long buried beneath cracked stone and whispering grass, once a beacon between what is and what may never be. This was where the Firstborn Angels had first set foot on mortal soil, where the concept of choice itself had crystallized into being. Ruins of impossible arches and half-melted runes lay silent for centuries, until that night when history itself shuddered.It began as a tremor in the soul of the world. I felt it not as reverberations through the earth, but as a shiver along the strands of memory. A pulse of energy roared up from the deepest vaults of Hollowreach, traveling along ley lines and through consecrated ground alike. Every chalice trembled in its pew, every banner snapped in its halt, and every heart tightened in sudden dread. It was as though the very Tapestry of Fate had caught fire, and its threads were snapping one by one.Then came the word—unspoken yet universal:“The Veil is broken.”It was both declaration and lamentation, ringing through minds across Fiondell with the weight of inevitability. Mortals looked skyward, their voices lifting in desperate litany, as if thunder and star-fire might answer back. Lanterns flickered in city streets, torches gleamed on watchtowers, and candlelight pooled in prayer halls as if seeking refuge. Yet while they lifted their eyes to the heavens, I turned inward, tracing the frayed cords of memory to the source of all unraveling.From that wound in the world emerged it—the Unwoven One. Imagine a form that is never static, a silhouette stitched from half-remembered dreams and fears too ancient to name. It had no voice that tongue could speak, no shape that mind could fully grasp. It drifted from the yawning rift like smoke caught in a dying breeze, fragments of silvery thread trailing behind, each one a lost possibility clawing its way back into existence.It was not born; it had been forgotten into being—a knot of fate untethered from the Loom. I felt the resonance of its presence in the dark corners of every soul, a cold finger tracing the outline of doubt in their hearts. And still, the mortals prayed. Dark-robed priests clutched their rosaries until their knuckles glowed white. Scholars muttered invocations in dead tongues. Mothers pressed their children to their chests, eyes wide with pleading. They reached for the gods and angels they had always known, reaching past the veil that no longer stood to catch them before they fell.But there was no salvation in their hands, only echoes. And I—Known, Keeper of Memory—stood silent witness, bearing every flicker of fear and flicker of hope that danced upon their lips. For I alone remembered what they had forgotten: that some wounds, once opened, demand a sacrifice far greater than prayer.When the veil’s threads lay bare and mortals cried out in terror, their voices wove together into a single desperate plea that tore past heaven’s threshold. In that moment, the ancient champions of the Tapestry answered—and I, Known, remembered every heartbeat of their descent.First came Lucina, the Angel of Damnation, her arrival heralded by a shattering silence. The sky split open like scorched parchment, and she fell through the void on wings of living flame. I recall how the light of her plumage turned night to day, how her descent rippled heat through the hearts of all who watched. Below her, voidspawn cowered as if their own births were blasphemy, and lesser creatures crumbled into ash beneath her gaze.Her voice—an oratory of scorching judgment—rolled across valleys and battlements, drowning even the whippoorwills’ evening song:\n“This world is under my judgment. You shall not unravel it.”\nMortals trembled at her words, yet in their fear lay recognition: she had come not to destroy, but to enforce the sacred law their own hands had threatened to shred.Before the embers even cooled, Prai, the Angel of Worship, appeared as a mote of perfect light. I saw her dawn upon the horizon like a second star—radiant and unwavering. Her presence was not thunder or flame but a gentle hum within the soul, a promise that faith still held power. Priests paused in mid‐chant, breath caught in their throats, as Prai’s single, crystalline word settled upon them:\n“Stand.”\nIn that command lay salvation. I witnessed knights steel their trembling hands upon sword hilts; I saw children lift their tear-streaked faces to absorb her warmth. Even the faintest flicker of hope grew into a torch in every breast, burning away despair.Angelic intervention is often grand, but Loki, the Angel of Mischief, chose subtler means. He did not blaze across skies; he slipped into minds like a half‐heard melody. I traced his laughter as it danced through the ranks of thieves hiding in the alleyways, rogues perched in shadowed rafters, even scholars clutching tomes by lamplight. His words twisted fear into curiosity:\n“Oh, what fun it is when the world flips itself inside out! Watch closely, mortals, for every riddle has an answer.”\nAnd so, I remember how hardened killers paused, perplexed by a sudden smile; how strategists found new brilliance in impossible odds; how the tide of dread receded as they embraced the unpredictable.Death did not announce herself with trumpets. She moved in the hush between blows, unseen and unfelt—yet deeply remembered in the minds of the dying. I was there at countless battlefronts, and in each final gasp, I saw her face: pale, serene, offering release. Her voice was a whisper that only a soul in its last moment can hear, promising rest:\n“Come with me, child of the Loom. Your thread finds peace in oblivion.”\nSoldiers fell knowing they were tended, their last fear soothed by her gentle hand. I carry their final farewells in my memory, each a testament that even in destruction, compassion endures.And last, emerging from the very shreds of the rift, was Destiny, the Angel of Fate. He walked forward upon strands of silver, as though the Unwoven One itself had offered him a bridge. His brass mask caught every flicker of the closing rift; his clockwork eyes measured the unraveling with infinite patience. When he spoke, his voice coursed through reality like a sword through silk:\n“The strand you walk was never meant to be yours. Return to the weave, or be unmade.”\nIn that pronouncement lay both mercy and power. I saw the Unwoven One hesitate, caught between arrogance and obliteration. Around Destiny, mortals felt the weight of their own choices: every prayer, every doubt, every strand they had pulled too far. In their hearts, they understood that no thread can stray without risking the whole tapestry.I stood on forgotten ramparts as angels and mortality wove together a new legend. Lucina’s fire clashed with shadow‐thread monsters. Prai’s light guided knights through churning hordes. Loki’s riddles spurred rogues to feats of daring beyond their creed. Death cradled the fallen. And Destiny, ever watchful, held the loom of fate steady.The battle for Hollowreach had begun—but it was more than combat. It was a remembrance: that even when the Veil shatters, the bonds of hope, defiance, and love can be reforged into something stronger than we ever knew. And as Known, I bear witness so that no one forgets how stars can burn anew in the darkest of nights.Through the ruptured skies I watched as the Unwoven One and the angels fought among the clouds, their struggle a storm of light against shadow. But far below, its children poured forth from the rift—monstrous spawn of loose fate given terrible form. I felt each one as a jarring pulse in memory’s loom: wolves whose howls unraveled the courage in a man’s heart, crows whose feathers unspooled like silk to ensnare the unwary, and grotesque parodies of humanity that crept from ruined doorways, their sewn‐together limbs twisting like living knotwork. Villages at Hollowreach’s edge vanished in a single night, consumed by hungry darkness. Survivors fled through burning fields, their voices ragged with tales of beasts that could unravel flesh like fabric, leaving hollow shells of those they touched.In every cathedral, in every camp, the call went out: the Church of Five rallied. I recall the echo of steel on stone as the Holy Knights mustered once more, their armor etched with prayers and sacrifice. Word carried of an impossible vision: the Silver Assembly—those wanderers of fate who had long been scattered—felt the tug of the same strand and returned. I saw Liora Mayne’s blade reborn in the crimson glow of the forge, each strike singing with ancient enchantment. Brother Callen, quill trembling over fresh parchment, inscribed rites to bind wavering souls. Lady Valeria donned her helm at dawn, her banner ripping the sky as she led a thousand warriors toward the breach, determination lighting her eyes brighter than any star.Then came the Battle of Hollowreach—a clash unlike any the world had known. Beneath Lucina’s inferno, steel rang against sinew of shadow. Beneath Prai’s steady glow, knights found strength to stand. Rogues guided by Loki’s riddles lurked through flickering flame, severing thread‐spawn at the source. Mages wove barrier and blessing even as Death’s soft hand guided fallen souls to their rest. I remember the world trembling under the thunder of hooves and wings, the air thick with ash, faith, and fear intertwined.For every beast that fell, two more surged forth. The rift’s edges pulsed with insatiable hunger. Yet amid the roar of battle, I did not sense despair but a quiet resilience. I felt it in the healer who rose from shattered pews to cradle the dying; in the young squire who clasped a broken sword to his side, refusing to yield; in the battered captain whose prayer, soft and urgent, bound the warriors in unbreakable solidarity. Each act of courage wove a new strand into the Tapestry, resisting the chaos that sought to tear it apart.And through it all, I stood apart and within, bearing witness. I held in memory every scream and every sigh of relief, every thread severed and every knot tied anew. The War of Threads was not merely a battle for Hollowreach—it was a testament to the living weave of hope and sacrifice that binds mortals and angels alike. Even as the rift pulsed, still open and yearning, I knew the story was far from over. Yet for that moment, in the heart of the fray, the light of unity shone brightest against the gathering void.At the apex of chaos, when celestial flame and shadow‐thread collided in a storm of light and sound, Destiny stepped forward. I felt the air itself tighten as he approached the rift, each footfall a measured echo through the clamor of battle. Around him, strands of fate—gossamer threads of silver and gold—coiled like living serpents, weaving a tapestry that pulsed with life and death. Mortals and angels alike watched in awe as those threads danced between Destiny and the Unwoven One, each strand a story, a prayer, a possibility given form.Where their filaments met, reality twisted. I remember a knight’s swing pausing mid‐air, frozen in determination. A healer’s prayer reversed itself, undoing the very wounds she had just bound. A child’s laughter skipped backward, unspooling like a ribbon. Time became a breath held too long, a river turned backward, until the world felt as delicate as spun glass.Destiny, ever patient, allowed his foe to believe it held power. The Unwoven One tugged at strands with feral glee, confident it could fray the Tapestry beyond repair. But I remembered every hidden stitch, every secret knot that bound creation. With a subtle motion—no more than a flick of brass and gold—Destiny rewove a single golden thread. The world itself froze.In that profound stillness, not a blade sang nor a shadow stirred. Even the wind stilled in mid‐gale. And then, across the silent expanse, his voice rang clear in every mind:\n“You have wandered from the Tapestry, little thread. Return to your place, or I will cut you free from all that exists.”\nFor the first time, the Unwoven One hesitated. I felt its form shudder, not in pain, but in the raw terror of oblivion—the void beyond memory, beyond being. It knew the weight of final erasure.Destiny offered the choice he grants all wayward threads:\n“Return. Or be forgotten.”\nA howl, vast and sorrowful, tore through the rift’s silent expanse. The Unwoven One convulsed as its strands recoiled, each fiber drawn unwillingly back into the Loom. I saw its hunger fade, its fury wane, until at last its will dissolved into the very fabric of fate.And then, as if exhaling its last breath, the rift began to close—stitch by trembling stitch, guided by hands unseen. The storm of war stilled into hushed wonder, and mortals and angels alike exhaled a breath they had not known they were holding.In that moment of quiet triumph, I—Known, Keeper of Memory—sealed this image into remembrance, that no soul might ever forget the price of wandering too far from the weave.When the final strand of the rift was woven closed, the roar of battle fell away like thunder carried off by the wind. Dust settled on shattered banners and spent weapons, and a hush—thick with wonder and relief—blanketed Hollowreach. One by one, the angels withdrew from the mortal coil, leaving behind echoes of their presence that lingered like the afterglow of sunrise.Prai whispered to the faithful, her voice soft as a lullaby carried on the night breeze. I remember how her radiance faded from sight but not from heart; in her parting words, every trembling soul found solace:\n“You are not alone. Even unseen, we are with you.”\nIn that moment, I felt the spark of courage reignite in splintered hearts—widows who had lost husbands, squires who had watched their comrades fall, children who had hidden beneath pews and emerged to a world forever changed. They rose from their knees, hands pressed to chest, breathing in the promise of presence beyond sight.Lucina stood before the surviving knights, her fiery wings folded, embers dancing in her stern gaze. I recall the weight of her judgment softened by respect—she who had turned voidspawn to ash now regarded mortals not as subjects of wrath, but as brethren of sacrifice. Her voice, firm as tempered steel, echoed over broken shields:\n“You have seen death and lived. Do not squander this mercy.”\nIn her words lay a challenge: that survival itself is a charge, a task bound in honor. I saw knights lift battered helms, eyes glistening with determination renewed. Each man and woman bore scars—some obvious, others etched deep within—yet none would allow those marks to fade into shame.Destiny lingered the longest, standing amid tangled timbers and scorched earth, his brass mask aglow in the dying light. For a heartbeat, time resumed its steady pulse as he regarded the mortals who dared stand against oblivion. No words passed; instead, a single thought settled into every mind like a seed planted in fertile soil:\n“Your thread is yours to weave. Do not fear the loom.”\nI watched as that notion took root. He left not with fanfare but in the silent certainty that his message would outlast even the echo of his departure. Where he had walked, hope took firmer shape.In the days that followed, Fiondell awoke to a new dawn. The Church of Five consecrated the ruins of Hollowreach, transforming shattered walls into sacred memorials. They declared the anniversary the Day of Threads, a holy observance marked by weaving ceremonies in every temple: mortals and clergy alike gathering to stitch silver and gold strands into tapestries that told of sacrifice, unity, and rebirth.I have listened in memory to pilgrims on that day, their hands trembling as they passed needles through fabric, each pull of thread a prayer for the fallen and a vow for the future. Children learn the tale in song, their voices bright against ancient stone. Scholars debate the precise turning of events, yet all agree on one truth: when mortals and angels stand together, even the frayed edges of fate can be reforged.Some claim that on the eve of the Day of Threads, if you stand in silent reverence beneath a moonlit sky, you can hear the faint hum of weaving—soft as a breath, steady as a heartbeat. They say it is Destiny walking unseen, or perhaps the faint echo of the Unwoven One’s last lament. I smile each time I hear these stories, for I know the sound is memory itself, woven into the world to remind every soul that no thread, once returned, is ever truly lost.And so the story endures—not as a tale of doom, but as a testament to resilience. I, Known, Keeper of Memory, remain its custodian, ensuring that every stitch of hope, every thread of courage, is never forgotten.- Known, Keeper of Threads, Watcher of Memory\nThis is what I recall. This is what you must not forget.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"The Tale of the Veil’s Shattering","level":2,"id":"The_Tale_of_the_Veil’s_Shattering_1"},{"heading":"I.

is a primordial entity of pure nothingness, an embodiment of the void that existed before creation. It was not crafted by the Five Gods but born from the empty spaces left untouched in their grand design. Unlike the gods, who shaped and wove existence into the Celestial Tapestry, Kryxis was never given a place, and its very essence was antithetical to creation.\nUnmaking: Everything Kryxis touches begins to unravel, as its nature is to consume and return all things to void. It does not destroy in the conventional sense—it erases, making it as though something never existed.\nThe Hunger: Kryxis craves a place in existence, but its very being is paradoxical—it cannot create, only consume. This hunger drives it to expand endlessly, devouring reality to make space for itself.\n<a data-href=\"Wraithborn\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Wraithborn</a>: The corruption Kryxis spread during its brief presence in the Tapestry gave birth to the <a data-href=\"Wraithborn\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Wraithborn</a>, shadowy entities of despair and emptiness that still haunt the world.\n<br><a data-href=\"Shadowmarked\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shadowmarked</a>: Mortals who were exposed to its power became the first <a data-href=\"Shadowmarked\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shadowmarked</a>, inheriting a connection to the void that grants them dark powers but tempts them toward oblivion.\nWhen Destiny gave Kryxis a single void-thread in the Celestial Tapestry, the Voidbringer failed to contain its hunger and instead began consuming creation itself. This led to a war between the gods and Kryxis, where even divine might struggled against the endless void.<br>In the final battle, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" data-href=\"Destiny, Archangel of Fate\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Destiny</a> sacrificed his place among the heavens to weave an unbreakable seal, banishing Kryxis to the <a data-href=\"Endless Expanse\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Endless Expanse</a>, a realm beyond time and space where its hunger could do no harm.

Temple of Demre","icon":"","description":"The Tapestry is not merely a religion; it is the sacred pattern upon which the entire world rests, a divine weave of lives, fates, and cosmic intentions. Its followers believe every soul is a thread in a grand design spun by the angel Destiny, steward of fate and time’s unknowable pattern.Demre Stade is the beating heart of The Tapestry. Built upon an ancient, enchanted faultline where ley energies cross like woven strands, the city radiates divine resonance. Pilgrims pour into its sacred boulevards from every corner of the continent, seeking blessings, prophecies, or glimpses of the living embodiments of faith — the Pope, the Holy Knights, or even a whisper from the Angels.Massive alabaster walls, inscribed with living scripture, encircle the city. Temples, courts, libraries, and pilgrimage houses form a maze of sacred institutions, all radiating around the Seat of the Twin Threads — a vast marble complex shared by the Pope and Queen.The Temple Knights are not just soldiers. They are judges, priests, paladins, bureaucrats, and prophets. Their armor is ceremonial and blessed, adorned with the crest of interwoven golden threads. They represent the law, the sword, and the will of both Queen of Demre and Pope of the Tapestry.\nTotal Number: ~11 million\nBased in Demre Stade: ~500,000\nStructure: Divine-Military Hybrid, split between Church and Crown The Pope, the highest mortal voice of Destiny, serves as the divine guide. The Queen of Demre, chosen by blood and ceremony, represents mortal governance and order. Together, they are The Twin Threads — seen as the warp and weft of worldly and divine will.\nThe Twin Threads – Pope &amp; Queen of Demre\nThe Pope speaks prophecy and issues holy decrees; the Queen commands the realms and defends the people. Together, they may ordain new Holy Knights.\nThe Eleven Holy Knights – Emissaries of the Divine\nEach represents a principle thread in The Tapestry (e.g., Valor, Mercy, Judgment, Sacrifice, etc.). They are half-saints, given sacred names upon ascension. They are not merely leaders; they are symbols, legends, and champions all chosen by different angels.\nThe Special Temple Guardians – Destiny’s Fangs\nA secretive force of 75 warriors chosen directly by Destiny, Archangel of Fate. They are half-seers, half-enforcers, acting on dreams, omens, and divine compulsion. Often Paladins of the Oath of Threads or Warlocks of the Fatebound Chain, they are Destiny’s personal instruments — feared and revered. Some call them the Threadcutters.\nTemple Commanders – Judges and Strategists\nAct as magistrates, generals, and interpreters of law. They often reside in regional temples, overseeing large sections of the world.\nTemple Guardians – Keepers of the Sacred Places\nThese soldiers are stationed at holy sites, libraries, and relic vaults. They are trained not just in warfare but in lore and divine security.\nTemple Captains – Masters of Legions\nEach Captain leads a force of 250,000, a massive responsibility requiring logistical, spiritual, and military mastery. Their commands are akin to small kingdoms in their own right.\nTemple Leaders – Platoon Commanders\nLeaders of a unit of 100 knights, often selected from among proven warriors and acolytes. They maintain discipline and religious adherence.\nTemple Priests and Nuns – Spiritual Guides\nThey maintain the rituals of The Tapestry, deliver sermons, and offer thread-readings (divinations of fate). Many are scholars of The Loomscript, the prophetic language of Destiny’s will.\nTemple Knights – Holy Enforcers\nThe primary soldier-priests of the order. They act as both battlefield warriors and city patrollers. Their weapons are blessed, and their oaths are binding.\nTemple Watchers – Peacekeepers and Judges of the People\nThese are the common faces of the Temple law. They wear simpler armor, yet their presence holds the force of divine mandate. They record all crimes in Threadbooks, which are said to be reviewed in visions by higher angels.\nChosen by Destiny himself, each of these 75 agents bears a mark — a glowing, shifting rune on the chest or forehead that pulses with strands of silver and violet light. They receive visions not from dreams but from weaving voids, glimpses into The Loom where threads tangle, rot, or unravel. Their mission is to cut those threads — people, events, or places — that would threaten the design.Common traits:\nEyes clouded with faint silver threadmarks Speak in prophetic riddles when under trance Tattoos or scars shaped like broken spirals Carry weapons made from Loomsteel, a rare divine metal said to sever fate itself They are both Paladins and Warlocks, a hybrid not tolerated in any other order. Their patron is the Archangel Destiny, who offers no love, only purpose.\nThe Loomvault: A hidden chamber beneath the Pope’s sanctum where the threads of saints and traitors are stored. Threadfever: A madness that can afflict those who try to read fate without divine blessing. Symptoms include speaking in multiple voices and bleeding woven patterns. Saints of the Spindle: Mortals whose lives impacted The Tapestry so greatly they became semi-immortal spiritual figures. Some Holy Knights are chosen from these. Date: Midyear, on the longest day\nPurpose: To symbolize that all lives are part of Destiny’s grand weave\nParticipants: The Pope, Queen, Holy Knights, and pilgrimsIn this great rite, enormous looms are erected in the plaza outside the Seat of the Twin Threads. Silken threads representing the virtues of the Eleven Holy Knights (Justice, Mercy, Sacrifice, etc.) are woven into a new sacred tapestry by the Pope and Queen. Each thread color is said to have been blessed by a different angel. The final tapestry is hung for a year in the Cathedral of Looming Fate and then ritually burned to send it back into the Time Stream.\nInvocation: The ceremony opens with the reading of the “First Stitch” — a poetic creation myth spoken by Temple Priests in a trance. Blessing of Threads: The names of the angels are called aloud in an ancient language. Public Participation: Children place symbolic threads into a side loom to represent their lives joining the weave. Date: On the darkest night of the year\nPurpose: To honor Lucina, Archangel of Damnation and reflect on death, judgment, and renewal\nParticipants: Priests of Trill, families of the deceased, and condemned criminalsA cold black flame is kindled from consecrated oil at midnight. This flame is said to be a piece of Lucina’s judgment. Names of the dead are read aloud, and people release ash-doves into the sky — folded paper birds burned in the black flame as offerings.\nForgiveness Ritual: Criminals and wrongdoers may choose to walk barefoot across the burning sigils of the Nine Chains of Hell and confess. Lucina’s Silence: All bells, voices, and music are forbidden until dawn to honor Lucina’s still and solemn reign over the dead. Date: First new moon of spring\nPurpose: To honor Fionil and her angels (especially Clock and Known), thanking them for the structure of time and knowledge\nParticipants: Scholars, judges, temple commandersEach participant brings one book or scroll to be placed in the Library of Threads. In silence, they walk a spiral path and offer their work to Known, Angel of Knowledge, who is said to read every word. A glass orb filled with starlight is then placed upon a tower that records this knowledge in ethereal script.\nStarlight Offering: Scribes read from ancient tomes aloud until sunrise. This is believed to slow the unraveling of fate. Hour of Stillness: At midnight, no one moves for one full hour as tribute to Clock, Angel of Time. Date: Mid-spring\nPurpose: To honor Tellemori and Plantios, Angel of Flora, invoking fertility and healing\nParticipants: Temple Guardians, nuns, farmers, druids, and midwivesFields outside Demre Stade are blessed with anointment oils and celestial seeds gifted yearly by Plantios. Songs are sung in shifting harmony, each representing the natural cycles. A single tree is planted in the Garden of Tellemori and blessed with water from all known rivers.\nProcession of Growth: Children dressed as fey or animals dance through the streets led by a masked priest of Lady of Fey. Night of Candles: Vows of love or reproduction are declared by couples. These are lit by candles representing Lady Love and watched over by Tellemori’s clergy. Date: On the summer solstice\nPurpose: To honor Drana, Archangel of Dragons and War, and the celestial dragons\nParticipants: All Temple Knights, especially initiatesNew knights are knighted by fire in a ritual pit of dragon-shaped braziers. They swear the Oath of the Tapestry before a statue of Drana and are marked with a glowing brand in the shape of a dragon's spiral tail.\nThe Wargame: Elite knights reenact ancient dragon battles using live magic and illusion to entertain and instruct. Blessing of Blades: Each sword or weapon is dipped in burning oil said to be a gift from Ignarion, the Firefather. Date: Varies; done privately\nPurpose: For the Special Temple Guardians (Threadcutters) who must sever a life or fate to protect the Tapestry\nParticipants: Only the Guardian, a senior priest of Destiny, and a silent witnessAfter following a vision from Destiny, a Threadcutter returns to Demre Stade and performs this solemn rite. In an underground chamber, they offer a prayer to Filla, the Angel of Feelings, to release emotional ties, then burn a thread marked with the name of the one whose fate they severed. Destiny does not answer; his silence is confirmation.\nThread of Silence: For seven days afterward, the Guardian may not speak. Wine of Memory: They drink an elixir that causes temporary loss of identity — a symbolic death and rebirth. Date: The night when day and night are perfectly equal\nPurpose: To honor Day and Night, twin angels of Flujack\nParticipants: Skywatchers, poets, clerics of the airAt dusk, all candles in the city are extinguished. Then, with a signal from the High Priest of Flujack, the city is relit by floating lanterns, each containing a single prayer written to Day or Night.\nNightglass Reading: Oracles gaze into obsidian mirrors to interpret signs from the changing sky. Dance of Balance: Dancers dressed in white and black intertwine in circles to the rhythm of wind-chimes and flutes. \"O Lady of Chains and Cinders,\nyou who cradle both sinner and saint—\nreceive the names of the fallen,\nweigh them in your hands of shadow and flame.\nLet none drift beyond your gaze.\nLet none escape your justice.\"\n—Excerpt from The Fifth Flame, Book of Trill \"From thread to thread, from breath to breath,\nDestiny sews what mortals guess.\nThe gods may speak, the fates may turn,\nbut all shall pass the weaving’s churn.\"\n—Sung by the entire plaza at the climax of the ceremony\nSpoken by Temple Knight Initiates as they kneel:\n\"By claw and coil, by fire and fate,\nI serve the roar, the war, the weight.\nLet Drana test my mettle pure—\nMy oath, like dragons, shall endure.\"\nThe brand is then applied, and a senior knight proclaims:\n\"Rise now as flame-forged kin of dragonkind. Serve the Eleven, the gods, and the Tapestry eternal.\" \"Bless this soil, and bless this soul.\nMay roots take hold, and hearts grow whole.\nUnder leaf and stone and stream,\nlet life awaken from its dream.\"\n—Spoken by a druid priestess while watering the sacred planting tree\nWhispered by scholars before entering the Spiral Path:\n\"Known, who records, Clock who turns,\nguide my hand so knowledge burns.\nLet not a moment be unscanned,\nnor a lie escape your watchful hand.\"\nAlso known as: The Loomscripture, The Eternal Weave, Threadbound LawThese are the guiding principles taught by temple priests and enforced by the Temple Knights:\nThe Thread Must Not Be Cut – Life is sacred, and no soul may be taken without divine cause.\nThe Weave is Shared – Aid your fellow beings, for their thread crosses yours by design.\nThe Pattern Must Be Known – Seek truth, study history, and never suppress divine or arcane knowledge.\nDo Not Burn the Loom – Acts of reckless destruction, especially against nature or magic, are sacrilege.\nThreads Must Consent to Be Woven – Deals, pacts, and oaths must be given freely.\nHonor the Threads of Blood and Oath – Family, companions, and sworn brothers must be protected and upheld.\nDeny Not the Cycle – Birth, love, war, death—all must be embraced in their time.\nDo Not Disguise the Thread in Lies – False prophecy and impersonation of angels or gods is punished by excommunication.\nThe Threads Must Be Judged in Kindness – Justice must be tempered with mercy, cruelty is a defilement.\nRemember You Are a Knot in a Greater Weave – No one is above the gods’ pattern. \"Clock turns, light burns,\nbless my steps through ordered days.\nLet not my heart outrun my duty.\" \"Drana of Scale, shield of wrath,\nlet my arm strike with divine path.\nNo blade in malice, no war unjust—\nonly for Tapestry, strike if I must.\" \"You who measure what may be,\nbind my wrongs and set me free.\nThread my soul through tested night,\nthat I emerge in truth and light.\" \"Fold the thread, close the eye.\nLet slumber fall like the quiet sky.\nGuide me through your velvet halls—\nuntil new light on waking calls.\"\n1. High Clergy (The Eleven Threadmasters &amp; the Pope):\nRobes of Gleaming Thread: Silk-like gold and white with interwoven threads representing each god’s domain. Thread-Crown: A circlet of braided platinum and opal strands, said to shimmer with fate. Sash of the Eternal Pattern: Worn diagonally across the chest, embroidered with celestial runes and a stylized loom. 2. Temple Knights:\nThreadbound Plate: Polished silver armor with gold-stitched undercloaks. The pauldron bears the sigil of their assigned angel. Mantle of Oath: A crimson-and-silver half-cape bearing their order's mark and rank thread. Ceremonial Brands: Dragon-scale tattoos or branded script across the collarbone for those sworn under Drana or Lucina. 3. Temple Priests and Watchers:\nVestments of the Loom: Modest robes in tones of pale blue, ash grey, and violet. Each has a single metallic thread trailing from shoulder to hem. Mask of Contemplation: Ornate half-masks made of wood or ceramic worn during prayer or judgment. Weaving Pillars: Towers or interior columns designed like spiraling braids or cords, often inscribed with timelines or bloodlines. Threadglass Windows: Stained glass in curling spiral or loom-like patterns—each pane tells a part of history or a divine parable. Skyloom Domes: Huge domes open to the sky with retractable cloth veils mimicking threads—used during eclipse rituals or holy nights. Celestial Loom: A central loom or altar in each major temple with magically suspended threads representing fate, choices, or past/present. The Cathedral of Endless Threads (in Demre Stade): The high holy site, housing the Eternal Loom—said to be woven by Destiny himself. Contains 23 sanctums, each for a known angel. The Chapel of Silence: A temple without sound, dedicated to Fionil and Known. Worshippers must remain silent within, using embroidered prayer flags and hand signs.\n“We are not swords. We are needles that thread justice through the cloth of the world.”The Temple Knights—especially the elite Tapestry Knights—are both protectors and enforcers of divine law. Sworn to the Tapestry Faith, they follow a strict moral and spiritual code handed down from Destiny, Drana, and the Eleven Holy Knights.\nOath Above All “My vow is a thread in the divine pattern. I shall not cut it, burn it, or stray from its path.” Justice Without Cruelty “I am not vengeance. I am resolution. I do not strike the unjudged, nor revel in pain.” Protect the Pattern “The innocent, the faithful, and the holy are to be shielded as sacred stitches in the world’s cloth.” Duty Before Self “I will lay down my glory, comfort, or life to preserve the Tapestry.” Truth is My Blade “I shall not deceive with word or silence. Lies are thorns in the weave.” Mercy to the Worthy “When I am able, I will offer redemption to the fallen. Severing a thread is the last resort.” Faith in All Things “Even when lost, even in silence, I trust the loom continues.”\nBreaking a sacred Thread (divine law) isn't just a crime—it’s a cosmic tangle, disrupting the will of the gods. Divine retribution is swift but offers paths to atonement. Punishments often manifest through visions, spiritual torment, or angelic intervention.\nPunishment: Marked by Lucina with a fading shadow that follows them silently; those nearby feel ill in their presence. Atonement: Offer soul service for one year as a Threadmender, a mute servant in a temple of Death or Lucina, caring for graves, ferrying souls, or slaying undead. Punishment: Tongue turns to thread or mouth is sewn shut in a dream until truth is spoken. Atonement: Public confession before a priest of Known or Fionil. A tapestry of their lie is woven in full detail and displayed in their local temple for 77 days. Punishment: Magic permanently misfires in their presence—can even cause random spell surges. Atonement: Construct a Threadvault: a protected library or sanctuary for divine knowledge. Must offer up their own life story as its first scroll. Punishment: Branded by a flaming chain across the chest by Drana’s spirit or an apparition of the Eleven. Atonement: Fight in three hopeless causes for the weak—survive or die, but not flee. Upon the third, the brand will fade or transform into a badge of renewed honor. Punishment: Dreams become haunted by angelic watchers, or the transgressor can’t walk upon temple grounds without burning pain. Atonement: Must build or restore three shrines with their own hands. The final shrine must be to an angel they wronged. Punishment: Bound by fate—they are now doomed to obey one command from another, randomly triggered. Destiny rewrites their choices until they learn humility. Atonement: Swear fealty as a Soulbound Servant to the person they wronged or to Destiny’s altar for one full season. Punishment: Struck from the Loom—name removed from temple archives, fate lost, and no angel can hear their prayers. Atonement (rare and difficult): Undertake the Pilgrimage of Threads, visiting all 23 angelic shrines, making a sacrifice at each, and letting Destiny choose if the thread may be rewoven. Punishment: Marked by Drana and Araxiel with a serpent-like shadow that trails the sinner, causing all dragons to recoil or attack. Fate magic misfires around them, and their dreams are haunted by the dying breath of the slain dragon. Atonement (arduous and sacred): Complete the Trial of the Wyrm’s Coil by raising a dragon’s egg to flight, offering a portion of their own soulfire at Drana’s altar, and earning forgiveness from a celestial dragon—only then may their thread be rewoven into the Loom of Fate.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"The Tapestry — Faith of Threads Eternal","level":3,"id":"The_Tapestry_—_Faith_of_Threads_Eternal_0"},{"heading":"Demre Stade — City of Faith","level":3,"id":"Demre_Stade_—_City_of_Faith_0"},{"heading":"The Temple Knights — Hands of the Divine","level":2,"id":"The_Temple_Knights_—_Hands_of_the_Divine_0"},{"heading":"Joint Leadership","level":3,"id":"Joint_Leadership_0"},{"heading":"The Hierarchy of the Temple Knights","level":2,"id":"The_Hierarchy_of_the_Temple_Knights_0"},{"heading":"The Special Temple Guardians (The Threadcutters)","level":2,"id":"The_Special_Temple_Guardians_(The_Threadcutters)_0"},{"heading":"Additional Lore Hooks","level":2,"id":"Additional_Lore_Hooks_0"},{"heading":"Yearly Coronation Rites","level":1,"id":"Yearly_Coronation_Rites_0"},{"heading":"1.

This repository stands as both map and mirror—a guide through the lands, peoples, powers, and secrets of a realm touched by divinity and shaped by destiny.At the heart of <a data-href=\"Fiondell\" href=\"realms/fiondell/fiondell.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fiondell</a> lies <a data-href=\"The tapestry\" href=\"the-tapestry.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The tapestry</a>: a grand, ever-weaving pattern that binds the threads of all existence. It is religion, reality, and revelation—its design glimpsed by saints, scholars, and seers alike. Every god, creature, and event is but a thread in this vast, unknowable weave.This encyclopedia was not merely penned by mortal hands, but guided by the quill of Known, angel of knowledge and truth, bearer of the title The Eternal Scholar. In service to curiosity and the preservation of understanding, Known has imbued these pages with insight unmarred by time or bias. Where clarity is rare, Known offers light.Use this compendium not just as a guide, but as a gateway—to stories old and yet unfolding, to powers celestial and forbidden, and to your place within the ever-growing Tapestry of Fiondell.Read deeply. Remember well. The threads are waiting.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["realms/fiondell/fiondell.html","the-tapestry.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"welcome.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749056657820,"modifiedTime":1749058261171,"sourceSize":1280,"sourcePath":"Welcome.md","exportPath":"welcome.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":94,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"}},"fileInfo":{"site-lib/scripts/graph-wasm.wasm":{"createdTime":1759003495844,"modifiedTime":1759003495116.4148,"sourceSize":23655,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/scripts/graph-wasm.wasm","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"other","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/94f2f163d4b698242fef.otf":{"createdTime":1759003677401,"modifiedTime":1759003677401,"sourceSize":66800,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/94f2f163d4b698242fef.otf","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/72505e6a122c6acd5471.woff2":{"createdTime":1759003677401,"modifiedTime":1759003677401,"sourceSize":104232,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/72505e6a122c6acd5471.woff2","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/2d5198822ab091ce4305.woff2":{"createdTime":1759003677402,"modifiedTime":1759003677402,"sourceSize":104332,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/2d5198822ab091ce4305.woff2","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/c8ba52b05a9ef10f4758.woff2":{"createdTime":1759003677402,"modifiedTime":1759003677402,"sourceSize":98868,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/c8ba52b05a9ef10f4758.woff2","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/cb10ffd7684cd9836a05.woff2":{"createdTime":1759003677402,"modifiedTime":1759003677402,"sourceSize":106876,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/cb10ffd7684cd9836a05.woff2","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/293fd13dbca5a3e450ef.woff2":{"createdTime":1759003677403,"modifiedTime":1759003677403,"sourceSize":105924,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/293fd13dbca5a3e450ef.woff2","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/085cb93e613ba3d40d2b.woff2":{"createdTime":1759003677403,"modifiedTime":1759003677403,"sourceSize":112184,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/085cb93e613ba3d40d2b.woff2","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/b5f0f109bc88052d4000.woff2":{"createdTime":1759003677405,"modifiedTime":1759003677405,"sourceSize":105804,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/b5f0f109bc88052d4000.woff2","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/cbe0ae49c52c920fd563.woff2":{"createdTime":1759003677405,"modifiedTime":1759003677405,"sourceSize":106108,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/cbe0ae49c52c920fd563.woff2","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/535a6cf662596b3bd6a6.woff2":{"createdTime":1759003677405,"modifiedTime":1759003677405,"sourceSize":111708,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/535a6cf662596b3bd6a6.woff2","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/70cc7ff27245e82ad414.ttf":{"createdTime":1759003677407,"modifiedTime":1759003677407,"sourceSize":192740,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/70cc7ff27245e82ad414.ttf","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/454577c22304619db035.ttf":{"createdTime":1759003677407,"modifiedTime":1759003677407,"sourceSize":161376,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/454577c22304619db035.ttf","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/52ac8f3034507f1d9e53.ttf":{"createdTime":1759003677406,"modifiedTime":1759003677406,"sourceSize":191568,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/52ac8f3034507f1d9e53.ttf","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/05b618077343fbbd92b7.ttf":{"createdTime":1759003677406,"modifiedTime":1759003677406,"sourceSize":155288,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/05b618077343fbbd92b7.ttf","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/fonts/4bb6ac751d1c5478ff3a.woff2":{"createdTime":1759003677400,"modifiedTime":1759003677400,"sourceSize":7876,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/fonts/4bb6ac751d1c5478ff3a.woff2","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"font","data":null},"site-lib/media/6155340132a851f6089e.svg":{"createdTime":1759003677400,"modifiedTime":1759003677400,"sourceSize":315,"sourcePath":"","exportPath":"site-lib/media/6155340132a851f6089e.svg","showInTree":false,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"media","data":null},"site-lib/media/230
