I remember everything.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember the way the stars dimmed during the Age of Shadows, when the gods turned their gaze away from the world—not out of cruelty, but necessity. Even I, whose purpose is to record all that was, all that is, and all that will be, could only observe as silence fell across the divine spheres. <a data-href="The tapestry" href="the-tapestry.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The tapestry</a> of time wove itself in solitude, trembling under the weight of mortal uncertainty.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was then, in that delicate stillness, that <a data-href="Fiondell" href="realms/fiondell/fiondell.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fiondell</a> began to fracture.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember how it started—not with a roar, but a whisper. A mortal, nameless then, touched a remnant of the void left behind by <a data-href="Kryxis" href="kryxis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kryxis</a>’s fall. That touch became hunger. That hunger, destruction. He took the name <strong>Blightking</strong>, and with void essence pulsing through his veins, he sought to unravel the very fabric I was meant to chronicle.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He desired not conquest, but erasure.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The lands twisted under his influence. Forests grew teeth. Rivers bled. Children born in his blighted realm came into the world weeping shadow. And I, in my endless halls of memory, felt the ink run thin—unable to keep pace with the unraveling threads.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Destiny, Archangel of Fate" data-href="Destiny, Archangel of Fate" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Destiny</a>... <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Destiny, Archangel of Fate" data-href="Destiny, Archangel of Fate" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Destiny</a> did what I could not.

He was young by our reckoning—a flicker of newness against the backdrop of the eternal—yet there was a gravity to him, as if time bowed slightly in his presence, not out of reverence, but recognition.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember his descent not as a blaze of glory or a clash of trumpets, but as something softer. The sky did not part. The world did not pause. He came wrapped in silence, wearing a cloak the color of old parchment, the fabric heavy with dust and meaning. His feet touched the ground with the quiet grace of inevitability. He looked like a man, yes—but only if one did not look too closely. His eyes held the weight of stars dying, of choices not yet made, and his shadow never quite matched the light around him.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mortals did not see him with their eyes. He passed them on crowded streets, through marketplaces and alleys, and they never turned. But they <em>felt</em> him. They always did. To walk near him was to feel something unsettled within—a itch at the back of the mind, a pressure in the chest like something long forgotten was trying to be remembered. Some said they had dreams that night—of crossroads, of turning points, of clocks with no hands ticking louder than thunder. Others woke with the knowledge they needed to speak to a stranger, quit a job, leave a lover, or walk a different road entirely. None could explain why. All they knew was that the feeling would not be denied.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Destiny, Archangel of Fate" data-href="Destiny, Archangel of Fate" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Destiny</a> did not come bearing a sword. He did not smite tyrants or command storms. His was not the intervention of fire and fury, but of gentle correction. A nudge. A whispered suggestion. The placing of a single stone on a path that would lead, in time, to a mountain’s collapse.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He was not alone in his work. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Prai, the Angel of Worship" data-href="Prai, the Angel of Worship" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Prai</a>—the eldest voice—still moved through the dreamscapes of the faithful, brushing against their sleep with the feather-light touch of prophecy. Though her body remained distant, her essence was ever present. Where <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Destiny, Archangel of Fate" data-href="Destiny, Archangel of Fate" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Destiny</a> laid down the thread, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Prai, the Angel of Worship" data-href="Prai, the Angel of Worship" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Prai</a> taught hearts how to follow it. Between them, a plan began to form—not rigid, but flowing. Not declared, but sung in a melody only a few could hear. A plan like <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind and order" data-href="Fionil, the goddess of time, space, mind and order" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fionil</a>’s constellations: intricate, delicate, precise—a thing of quiet beauty and boundless meaning, visible only when you stepped far enough back.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I—I who was forbidden to touch, to speak, to alter—I watched. I observed from the spaces between time, where all things unfold both at once and not at all. I watched as they began their work. I recorded each moment, each choice, each soul turned ever so slightly toward the light or the dark. I marveled as mortals shifted not from command or threat, but from the subtle pull of purpose.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-h3"><h3 data-heading="**The Birth of the Holy Knights**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Birth_of_the_Holy_Knights**_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span><strong>The Birth of the Holy Knights</strong></h3></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">They were not born into greatness.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No coronation marked their rise, no divine proclamation split the heavens. There were no flames dancing across their foreheads, no halos etched in light. They came from quiet places, forgotten corners of the world. A scholar who couldn’t steady his hands when he prayed. A farmer whose fingers were more familiar with soil than scripture. A soldier who had stopped believing in heroes because he had buried too many.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And yet—<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Destiny, Archangel of Fate" data-href="Destiny, Archangel of Fate" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Destiny</a> found them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Not with fanfare, but with stillness. He came to them in moments of solitude, when the world fell away and only doubt remained. He did not demand their service. He simply stood beside them. Sometimes, he said nothing at all. Other times, he asked a single question, the kind that clung to the ribs and echoed for years: <em>“What if it could be different?”</em></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Prai, the Angel of Worship" data-href="Prai, the Angel of Worship" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Prai</a>’s voice drifted in silence, not like thunder, but like memory. She came not in visions but in feelings—the sense that someone was listening when they prayed into the dark. Her presence warmed cold nights and turned fear into the first step forward. She whispered not of miracles, but of responsibility. The gods, she said, had not abandoned the world.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">They were trusting it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, one by one, they changed.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Not all at once.

I watched as faith, long dormant in their hearts, kindled into action. I saw fear—raw, honest fear—twist and reshape itself into resolve so sharp it could cut through despair. Their souls began to glow in <a data-href="The tapestry" href="the-tapestry.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The tapestry</a> of fate, not with the blinding purity of angels, but with the fierce gold of mortals who <em>chose</em> to stand.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was beautiful.

<li data-line="0" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span><strong>The Lightbound Blade</strong>, a weapon that sang in sunlight, its edge humming with ancient radiance. It did not shine in the dark—it <em>called</em> the light to return.<br>
</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span><strong>The Mantle of Aegis</strong>, not armor but a cloak, soft and warm. It did not repel darkness with force—it <em>shielded</em> like a mother’s arms, like a memory of safety no horror could touch.<br>
</li>
<li data-line="4" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span><strong>The Hourglass of Eternity</strong>, deceptively small, worn as a single earring. Yet within it, time whispered—not loudly, but persistently. It could not change fate, but it could make one <em>pause</em>, breathe, and choose.<br>
</li>
<li data-line="6" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span><strong>The Tear of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Trill, The god of life, death, Divine and Dragons" data-href="Trill, The god of life, death, Divine and Dragons" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Trill</a></strong>, not a jewel but a living memory, soft with sorrow. It pulsed with a quiet glow, and when it touched wounds—of flesh or spirit—it did not merely heal. It <em>understood</em>. It mourned with the wounded.<br>

The Final Thread.<br>
The moment every whisper of prophecy had warned of, every tremble in the weave had hinted at.<br>
The battle not of gods—but of a world gasping for its breath.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The <strong>Blightking</strong>, once a name, now a <em>force</em>, rose over the horizon like a second moon—bloated, pulsing, leaking void from wounds the world had forgotten to close. His shadow fell across nations. His voice turned rivers black. His army was not of men, but of the undone—things stripped of name and will and woven only of ruin.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The skies groaned, rupturing under the pressure of what he had become. The land buckled, split, screamed.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And mortals… they despaired.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">They knelt in dirt that bled.

But from <em>within</em> the dust, where hope had died.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The <strong>Holy Knights</strong> rose—not in chariots of gold, not with wings of fire, but in silence, grit, and grace. They stood where armies had broken. They walked through the ash as though they remembered what the sky once looked like. They bore no crowns. Only scars. But when they stepped forward, even the stars seemed to pause.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was not divinity that marked them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was determination.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember the <strong>sound</strong> before I remember the light.<br>
The clash of relic meeting rot. The cry of a soul refusing to vanish.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Ser Altharion</strong> moved through the battle like a prayer made blade. His sword, the <strong>Lightbound</strong>, did not scream with fury—it <em>sang</em> with clarity, slicing through the darkness with the elegance of truth. Each swing a sunrise. Each step a hymn. And when he faltered, others followed where he had carved the path.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Lady Valeria</strong> was the storm’s quiet eye.<br>
She knelt among the fallen, hands trembling but never still. She wept for each dying breath—but she did not break.

It wrapped around crumbling ramparts, caught falling stones, turned back the void’s grasp like a mother shielding her child.

It hissed with the fury of every injustice ever endured. Its bearer left trails of glass behind him, the ground too scorched to hold its fury. He fought not with rage—but <em>judgment</em>.

No trumpets. No light from the heavens. Just the faint hush that passes over a crowd when they all feel, in their bones, that something final has come.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He walked through the ruin without stirring dust.<br>
The void did not reach for him.<br>

It was <strong>certainty</strong>.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He did not command.

The <strong>Blightking’s soul</strong>—twisted, swollen, hollowed by void—was bound not just to this world, but to something beneath it. <strong><a data-href="Kryxis" href="kryxis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kryxis</a>.</strong><br>
The eternal knot of corruption. The wound that never healed.<br>

Older than words. Older than the angels.<br>
I should know—I was there when it was first whispered.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But such things always demand a cost.<br>
A life willing to be unmade. Not consumed. Not killed.

—<strong>in every piece of himself he gave away to keep the light burning.</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This wasn’t martyrdom.<br>
It was <strong>completion</strong>.<br>
His life had been a gift.<br>
And now, he gave it back.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The ritual began.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Lady Valeria</strong>, still bloodied, still kneeling by the wounded, collapsed to her knees. Her cries were raw, wordless, <em>too mortal for the moment</em>.<br>
She tried to stop him, even knowing she could not.<br>

They rose—not from the ground, but from within.<br>
Each hummed with what remained of the gods’ will, but it was <strong>Altharion’s soul</strong> that bound them together.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He became not a man. Not a knight.<br>
Not even a weapon.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He became <strong>a will</strong>.<br>
Sharp. Brilliant.

Not with fury.<br>
But with <strong>clarity.</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Straight through the Blightking’s heart.<br>

The earth trembled in a final shudder, and then, with a grace that defied the destruction that had come before, it <em>repaired itself</em>. The void, once so consuming, slithered back into the corners from which it had emerged. <strong>Hissing</strong> like a wound denied its infection.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Life returned.</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The trees, once charred and twisted by the void, stretched tall once more.<br>

They had stood at the edge of the abyss, and now they had to live with the <strong>memory</strong> of what they had done. What they had sacrificed.<br>
What they had become.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Ser Altharion</strong> was gone. His sacrifice had closed the rift. But in his absence, something lingered. A feeling no mortal could ever truly shed.<br>
They had become something more than mortal, but in that transformation, they had also become something <strong>less</strong>—less certain of their place in the world. More aware of the fragility of it all.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Their eyes</strong>—once full of hope, now held galaxies of <strong>sorrow</strong>.

Every tear in the fabric of fate.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Their hands</strong>, trembling not from fear, but from the <strong>weight</strong> of memory—of what they had seen the gods do through them. Of what they had seen themselves become.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">They had felt the touch of divinity—<em>yes</em>—but it had not been a divine touch that made them holy. No, it was their <strong>own choices</strong>. Their willingness to <strong>sacrifice</strong>—not just their lives, but their <strong>humanity</strong>—that made them more than mortal. And they felt it, with every step they took.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Some of the knights wandered.<br>
Their hearts too heavy for peace. Too fractured to rest. They roamed, seeking what they had lost in the fires of battle—<strong>hope</strong>, <strong>purpose</strong>, <strong>meaning</strong>.

Their names fading into the dust they had once <em>conquered</em>.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But not all were lost.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Others, like <strong>Lady Valeria</strong>, turned inward.

Not once did she seek praise or adulation. She never needed it. She had <strong>already been made</strong> more than any title could proclaim. Instead, she walked. Quietly. With grace. With a purpose that was hers alone. But wherever she went—wherever her steps echoed—people spoke of how their <strong>dreams</strong> grew brighter. How their hearts grew lighter.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And though they never saw her cry—<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Known, Angel of Knowledge" data-href="Known, Angel of Knowledge" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Known</a> saw it.<br>
